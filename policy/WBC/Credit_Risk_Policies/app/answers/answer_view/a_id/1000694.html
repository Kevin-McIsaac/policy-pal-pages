<h2><a name="A_About_this_policy"></a><strong><span><span><span><span>1. About this policy</span></span></span></span></strong></h2>

<h3><a name="A_Definition_of_a_borrower"></a><strong><span><span><span><span>1.1 Definition of a borrower</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span><span>Borrowers / applicants are individual / natural person(s) <strong>and</strong> non-natural entities that are eligible to access the suite of Residential Lending Products (consumer mortgage products) assessed under Consumer Lending Policies.<br />
&nbsp; </span></span></span>

<h3><a name="A_What_is_the_loan_purpose?"></a><strong><span><span><span><span>1.2 What is the loan purpose?</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span><span>The loan purpose indicates the reason why a borrower is applying for a loan. The purpose of the loan is used to make a decision on the borrower’s suitability, eligibility, the risk associated with the transaction as well as setting the appropriate pricing for the loan.</span></span></span><br />
<span><span><span>Note loan purpose and borrower type also determines whether the National Credit Code (NCC) applies. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</span></span></span>

<h3><a name="A_Why_this_policy"></a><strong><span><span><span><span>1.2.1 Why this policy</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span><span>The purpose of this policy is to provide an overview of: </span></span></span>

<ul>
	<li>The acceptable borrowers for Consumer Mortgage loans</li>
	<li>The acceptable loan purposes for Consumer Mortgage loans</li>
	<li>Co-Borrowers eligibility requirements for Consumer Mortgage loans</li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>Loans may be made available to existing customers or non-customers provided they can meet Bank eligibility criteria and the loan is deemed not unsuitable.&nbsp; Applicants need to demonstrate: </span></span></span>

<ul>
	<li>The legal capacity to enter into a Credit Contract. (Bank policy requires that the minimum age of an applicant must&nbsp;be 18 years).</li>
	<li>A satisfactory financial position for age/income with the ability to meet all existing and proposed commitments in accordance with the Bank's debt servicing criteria without enduring financial hardship.
	<ul>
		<li>
		<ul>
			<li><span><span><span><span>It is contrary to credit policy to add a borrower to any loan facility to increase servicing / borrowing power.</span></span></span></span></li>
			<li><span><span><span>Furthermore, guarantor income <b>may not</b> be added to borrower income when assessing servicing capacity, except where permitted under <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000696"><em><span><span><span><span>Guarantees</span></span></span></span></em></a> <em><span>policy</span></em>.</span></span></span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If they are a co-borrower, that they are receiving a substantial benefit from the loan transaction - refer <a data-tagid="R_Co-borrower_eligibility_requirements" href="#R_Co-borrower_eligibility_requirements">Co-borrower eligibility requirements</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>A satisfactory credit history.</li>
	<li>Stability in employment with a regular, predictable and verifiable income source.</li>
	<li>Stable residency or mobility through employment (e.g. teacher, police officer etc.)</li>
	<li>They are not aware of any significant changes to their financial situation over the next 3 years that would adversely impact their ability to meet loan repayments.

<h3><a name="R_Customers_Experiencing_Vulnerability"></a><strong><span><span><span><span>2.4 Customers Experiencing Vulnerability</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span><span>When interviewing a customer or processing a consumer mortgage loan application, you must take extra care: </span></span></span>

<ul>
	<li>If you notice a vulnerability&nbsp;</li>
	<li>if a vulnerability is disclosed to your&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>Customer vulnerability refers to customers in circumstances which make them more susceptible to harm, loss, or disadvantage (either personal or financial) than a person not in those circumstances. This means that they may require extra care to help them achieve a similar service outcome to someone who is not in vulnerable circumstances.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Vulnerable customers include those experiencing:</span></strong></span></span></span><br />
<span><span>A. Age-related impairment.<br />
B. Cognitive impairment.<br />
C. Elder abuse.<br />
D. Family or domestic violence.<br />
E. Financial abuse.<br />
F. Mental illness or mental health problems.<br />
G. Serious illness and severe or long-term illness.<br />
H. Gambling<br />
I. Scams<br />
J. any other identifiable personal, or financial, circumstance causing significant detriment&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are many types of vulnerability and learning a catalogue of circumstances may not always be helpful. Be alert to recognise the potential signs of someone experiencing vulnerable circumstances and use the extra care mindset: </span></span>

<ul>
	<li>Act with Sensitivity</li>
	<li>Act with Compassion</li>
	<li>Act with Respect</li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>It is with that extra care mindset, that &nbsp;&nbsp;Brokers are to ensure all borrowers and guarantors fully understand the commitment they are entering into.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />

<strong><span>When to take application notes:</span></strong></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span><span>The needs of a vulnerable customer must be considered prior to submitting an application. Unless it’s directly related to the&nbsp;Suitability Assessment under Responsible Lending&nbsp;obligation, Brokers must not make records about a customer’s potential or actual vulnerability as this may be a breach of the customers privacy.</span></span></span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span><span><span>If the customer's vulnerability impacts the&nbsp;<a href="#R_Suitability_Assessment_under_Responsib">Suitability Assessment under Responsible Lending</a>&nbsp;obligation, Brokers must enter notes in&nbsp;ApplyOnline&nbsp;to provide a justification for the loan to proceed under Responsible Lending laws, regardless of whether the customer provides explicit consent. Similarly, you do not need to request consent to record notes when the information directly relates to the applicant(s)’ financial ability to service the new loan application.</span></span></span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span><span><span>Notes on vulnerability for the Suitability Assessment must: </span></span></span>

<ul>
	<li>Be factual only</li>
	<li>Not express an opinion or be defamatory</li>
	<li>Limit information to what is absolutely necessary to satisfy the <a href="#R_Suitability_Assessment_under_Responsib"><em>Suitability Assessment Responsible Lending</em></a> obligation.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<span><span><span>Where a customer requests the vulnerability information not be recorded and this is directly relevant to the Suitability Assessment or their financial ability to service the loan, the application must not commence.</span></span></span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span><span><span>Should a customer tell you they are in vulnerable circumstances and need assistance, please contact the Broker Hotline to advise that the customer is in a vulnerable circumstance and requires extra care, so that extra care can be provided.</span></span></span>

<span><span><span>A loan should not be structured as a co-borrower loan where the customer is better suited to be a guarantor simply to enable processing.</span></span></span><br />

<h4><a name="R_Substantial_benefit_test"></a><strong><span><span><span><span>2.5.2 Substantial benefit test</span></span></span></span></strong></h4>
<span><span><span>A substantial benefit requires that each co-borrower must get a real and tangible benefit arising out of the underlying transaction. That is, where there are 2 or more co-borrowers:</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span><span>Property Purchase</span></span></span>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Each co-borrower has a direct legal or equitable ownership interest of at least 30%<sup>*</sup> in the asset (i.e. property) being purchased with the loan funds</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>Refinance</span></span></span>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>At least 30%<sup>*</sup> of the loan funds will be used to repay or refinance debts or other obligations in each co-borrower’s name.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>Equity Release / Cash out</span></span></span>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>At least 30%<sup>*</sup> of the released equity / cash out loan funds will be used for the direct benefit of each of the co-borrowers.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>Where loan funds will be used for multiple purposes, each of the co-borrowers must receive a substantial benefit of the total loan amount.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span><span><sup>*</sup>If there are more than two co-borrowers, or the co-borrowers have different levels of ownership, then the percentage figure may be reasonably adjusted. For example, 4 co-borrowers could be 25% each.
