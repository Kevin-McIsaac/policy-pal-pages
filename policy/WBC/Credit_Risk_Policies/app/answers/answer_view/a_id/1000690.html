<h3><a name="R_Definition_of_a_commitment"></a><strong><span><span>1.1 Definition of a commitment</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>A commitment is any regular repayment which a <strong><span>b</span><strong><span>orrower or income guarantor (Spousal-Income Guarantee or Spousal-Income + Security Guarantee) </span></strong></strong></span></span><span><span>may have. Commitments may be referred to as a debt, liability or facility which may be secured or unsecured.  The commitment may vary from payment to payment, like the minimum payment on a credit card or be fixed at a nominated amount, for instance a personal loan repayment with a fixed interest rate.<br/>
<br/>
Excludes items which are captured within <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000700"><em><span>Living Expenses</span></em></a></span></span><span><span> policy.<br/>
  </span></span>
<h3><a name="A_Why_this_policy"></a><strong><span><span>1.2 Why this policy</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>This policy will help you in verifying existing commitments and repayment conduct.<br/>
<br/>
This is a key part of the unsuitability assessment and is required for every applicant who is either a borrower or income-reliant guarantor. <br/>
<br/>
Verification of the applicant's commitments ensures accurate information is used in completing a financial assessment and serviceability calculation.<br/>
<br/>
Repayment history on existing debts is considered to be a critical indicator of an applicant's credit worthiness and ability to meet commitments.<br/>
<br/>
This policy is applicable where the loan activity is a: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>New loan application</li>
<li>Loan increase</li>
<li>Any loan variation activity requiring a serviceability assessment</li>
</ul>
<span><span>You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to: </span></span>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710">Serviceability assessment</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698">Loan Application and Approval &gt; Validation of information provided by the customer</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000700">Living expenses</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000692">Document Standards</a></li>
</ul>
<span><span> <br/>
If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000725">Lenders Mortgage Insurance</a> where required.   </span><br/>
  </span>
<h2><a name="R_Rules_you_must_apply"></a><strong><span><span>2. Rules you must apply</span></span></strong></h2>
 

<h3><a name="R_Policy_exclusions"></a><strong><span><span>2.1 Policy exclusions</span></span></strong></h3>
  <span><span>This policy does not apply to a Bridging ICAP loan without an end debt.  </span></span><br/>
 
<h3><a name="R_Customer_commitments"><strong><span><span>2.2 Customer commitments</span></span></strong></a></h3>
<br/>
<span><span>To ensure we accurately assess our customer's financial position we need to: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Collect information about their commitments.  </li>
<li>Verify the details of the commitment, refer to: 
	<ul>
<li><a href="#R_Confirm_the_details_of_the_commitment">Confirm the details of the commitment </a></li>
<li><a href="#R_Evidence_satisfactory_repayment_histor">Financial hardship arrangement check and evidence satisfactory repayment history</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
 

<h3><a name="R_Conflicting_information"><strong><span><span>2.3 Conflicting information</span></span></strong></a></h3>
<span><span>Further investigation may be required if we have identified any conflicts between any information (including Comprehensive Credit Bureau Report (CCR) data where applicable) and other supporting documents provided by the applicant.  Refer to </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698">Loan Application and Approval &gt; Validation of information provided by the customer</a><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>In addition to the Commitments policy requirements, Brokers are reminded to complete the scrutiny activity as outlined in </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698">Loan Application and Approval &gt; Validation of information provided by the customer</a><br/>

<span><span><b>Business commitments</b></span></span><br/>
<span><span>Where a business commitment is:</span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Held in a personal name, is not declared as a personal liability </span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Has been verified as accounted for in the entity tax returns / financials <b>and</b> </span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Has been included with the self-employed income assessment in the Broker Serviceability Calculator (for a partnership, company or trust) </span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span>This is not to be considered an undeclared liability or a CCR mismatch.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>Where the self-employed entity is a sole trader</span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>The commitment must be included as a personal liability of the individual (within OBP / ApplyOnline)</span></span><br/>
	 </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="R_Confirm_the_details_of_the_commitment"><strong><span><span>2.4 Confirm the details of the commitment</span></span></strong></a></h3>
<span><span><span>In all cases, the commitment details entered into the loan assessment system or calculator (e.g. OBP, Broker Serviceability Calculator) must match the information to be verified from CCR and/or a supporting document (where required), except where detailed in <a data-tagid="R_Allowable_variances" href="#R_Allowable_variances">Allowable Variances</a></span></span></span>

<li>Where a borrower is experiencing difficulty paying their current commitments, they may enter into formal financial hardship arrangements with a credit or finance provider.  Poor conduct may occur even where such arrangements are in place.</li>
<li>Identifying and reviewing performance of formal financial hardship arrangements applies to active commitments held by borrowers and / or income guarantors which are listed on the CCR bureau report.</li>
<li>You are required to manually obtain and review the PDF version of the CCR bureau report to identify if the customer is specifically in temporary relief or has a deferral financial hardship arrangement in place and they are operating within the agreed arrangements.</li>
<li>The ‘financial hardship arrangement check’ policy applies to commitments held with both the Westpac Group or external parties1 for each commitment type which appears on the CCR and tells us how to complete a financial hardship arrangement check.</li>
<li>For internal accounts<sup>1</sup> only, the credit decision will apply additional checks to identify if a borrower and / or income guarantor is in a financial hardship arrangement.</li>
