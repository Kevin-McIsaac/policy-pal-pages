&nbsp;

<h3><a name="R_Definition_of_a_commitment"></a><strong><span><span>1.1 Definition of a commitment</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>A commitment is any regular repayment which a <strong><span>b</span><strong><span>orrower or income guarantor (Spousal-Income Guarantee or Spousal-Income + Security Guarantee) </span></strong></strong></span></span><span><span>may have. Commitments may be referred to as a debt, liability or facility which may be secured or unsecured.&nbsp; The commitment may vary from payment to payment, like the minimum payment on a credit card or be fixed at a nominated amount, for instance a personal loan repayment with a fixed interest rate.<br />
<br />
Excludes items which are captured within <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000700"><em><span>Living Expenses</span></em></a></span></span><span><span> policy.<br />
&nbsp; </span></span>

<h3><a name="A_Why_this_policy"></a><strong><span><span>1.2 Why this policy</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>This policy will help you in verifying existing commitments and repayment conduct.<br />
<br />
This is a key part of the unsuitability assessment and is required for every applicant who is either a borrower or income-reliant guarantor.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Verification of the applicant's commitments ensures accurate information is used in completing a financial assessment and serviceability calculation.<br />
<br />
Repayment history on existing debts is considered to be a critical indicator of an applicant's credit worthiness and ability to meet commitments.<br />
<br />
This policy is applicable where the loan activity is a: </span></span>

<ul>
	<li>New loan application</li>
	<li>Loan increase</li>
	<li>Any loan variation activity&nbsp;requiring a serviceability assessment</li>
</ul>
<span><span>You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to: </span></span>

<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;<a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710">Serviceability assessment</a></li>

</ul>
<span><span>&nbsp;<br />
If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000725">Lenders Mortgage Insurance</a> where required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />

&nbsp; <span><span>This policy does not apply to a Bridging ICAP loan without an end debt.&nbsp; </span></span><br />
&nbsp;
<h3><a name="R_Customer_commitments"><strong><span><span>2.2&nbsp;Customer commitments</span></span></strong></a></h3>
<br />
<span><span>To ensure we accurately assess our customer's financial position we need to: </span></span>

<ul>
	<li>Collect information about their commitments. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Verify the details of the commitment, refer to:&nbsp;
	<ul>
