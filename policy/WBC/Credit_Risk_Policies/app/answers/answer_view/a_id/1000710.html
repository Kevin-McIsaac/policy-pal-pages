<h4><strong>&nbsp; <a name="R_Serviceability_Repayment_Amount"></a>2.5.3 Serviceability Repayment Amount</strong></h4>
<span><span><span>The&nbsp;</span></span></span><i><span><span><span>Serviceability Repayment Amount </span></span></span></i><span><span><span>is the repayment amount which is ultimately used within the serviceability assessment. The repayment amount is determined by the type of liability and can be either:</span></span></span>&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li><em>Benchmark Repayment Amount -&nbsp;</em>refers to repayment value which has been calculated by the Bank for serviceability purposes only</li>
	<li><em>Customer Declared Contracted Repayment Amount -&nbsp;</em>refers to&nbsp;the contracted repayment amount for the commitment&nbsp;as declared by the customer</li>
	<li>The higher of the commitment <strong>current</strong> balance or limit is used in the <em>Benchmark Repayment Amount </em>calculation, except where the below apply:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#R_Commitment_being_refinanced_using_loan"><em>Commitment being refinanced using loan funds</em></a></li>
		<li><a href="#R_Amended_current_commitment"><em>Amended current commitment</em></a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span>Loans originated concurrently, or existing loans with a concurrent loan activity, it is important that the correct repayment is assigned to the associated liability in each application</span></span></span></li>

			<b>New wording </b><br />
			The ‘<i>Apportioned shared commitment rule’ </i>is an option which can be used when&nbsp;serviceability fails based on the&nbsp;‘Default shared commitment rule’. &nbsp;<br />
			<br />
			To be eligible for the apportioned shared commitment rule, the borrower(s) or income guarantor(s) (WBC only)&nbsp;share an existing commitment with another borrower <b>who is not</b>:

			<ul>
				<li><span><span>The spouse of the borrower and not a co-borrower on the new loan or loan variation being assessed, or</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>An income guarantor&nbsp;(WBC only) on the new loan or loan variation being assessed</span></span></li>
			</ul>
			In addition to the above, the commitment type must allow an apportioned serviceability repayment amount. To identify if the commitment is eligible to be apportioned, refer to following sections in this chapter:

			<ul>
				<li><span><span>Serviceability Repayment Amount </span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>Benchmark Repayment Amount – Mortgage</span></span>
				<ul>

					<li><span><span>Benchmark Repayment Amount calculation – external<sup>1</sup> existing mortgage</span></span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			&nbsp;<br />
			The applicant’s apportioned share of the commitment used in serviceability assessment is based on&nbsp;the <u>highest</u> of the below categories.<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<i>(<b>Note</b>: the content contained in the Apportioned repayment categories table has not been changed) </i><br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			Apportioned shared commitment rule is <b>not</b> available when:

			<ul>

				<li><span><span>Any co-borrower / income guarantor (WBC only) of the shared commitment resides outside of Australia </span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>The existing commitment is shared between spouses only (both spouses residing at the same address and both spouses residing at different addresses). </span></span><span><span>If the borrower and non-borrower spouse reside at different addresses, the borrower has to take on the full responsibility for both their own as well as the spouse’s portion of the debt.</span></span></li>

			<span><b>&nbsp;</b></span><br />

			<br />
			<b>Serviceability calculation</b><br />
			The portion of the expense or commitment repayment used in the serviceability assessment will be based on the borrower’s contribution to the total household income i.e. by calculating the borrower’s income as a percentage of total household income (i.e. borrower + spouse income), and applying that same percentage to shared household living expenses and commitments.<br />
			<br />
			The borrower’s contribution to household income must be evidenced by verifying both&nbsp;the borrower&nbsp;and non-borrower’s (borrower’s spouse) income. The non-borrower (borrower's spouse) must be verified using the following income verification method:</span></span></span></span>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>PAYG&nbsp;must be verified using standard income verification policy. Refer to&nbsp;</span><span><span>Verifying Income</span></span><span>&nbsp;policy.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Self Employed non-borrower must be verified using Fast Track self-employed assessment. The full Fast Track policy including ‘Eligibility’ and ‘Exclusion’ criteria applies. Refer to&nbsp;</span><span><span>Self Employed Applicants</span></span><span>&nbsp;policy.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<br />
			<span><span><span><span><b>Notes:</b><br />
			When the Apportioned household expense and shared commitments - Spousal same household option is applied the HEM band calculation is not apportioned and remains determined based on total household income. The HEM value used in serviceability (determined based on total household income) will be apportioned under this policy option.<br />
			<br />
			In OBP the following are categorised as expenses:</span></span></span></span>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Outgoing rent / board</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Outgoing child support (maintenance)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

			</ul>
			<span><b>&nbsp;</b></span><br />
			<span><b><span><span><span>Verification requirements</span></span></span></b><br />
			<span><span><span>When the Apportioned household expense and shared commitments - Spousal same household policy option is applied, the broker must sight the non-borrower spouse privacy and consent, identification, and income verification documents.
