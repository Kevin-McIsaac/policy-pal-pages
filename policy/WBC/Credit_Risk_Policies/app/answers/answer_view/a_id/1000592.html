 <span><span>This policy will help you determine which real estate and non-real estate securities we consider acceptable for consumer mortgages.</span></span>
<div><span><span>To determine the maximum loan to value ratio (LVR) and valuation requirement for each type of asset offered as security, refer to the </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000606"><em> Assessing Loan to Value Ratio policy </em></a><span><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000606"> </a>and </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000607"><em> Assessing Residential Security Value policy </em></a><a href="http://CHAPTER	ATTACHMENT	Answer ID	URL	Links Done 	links unable to find"><span><span>. </span></span></a></div>
<h3><strong><span><span><span><a id="what is residential" name="what is residential"></a>1.2 What is residential real estate security?</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>The Bank’s consumer mortgage lending policy is primarily directed towards standard residential real estate.<br/>
The security is to meet the objective of ensuring the borrower’s root of title, the Banks’ ability to register its mortgage and having marketable value sufficient to offset the Bank’s exposure during the term of the facility.<br/>
When assessing the market value of the security, the following factors are to be taken into account: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Downturn in market values resulting in decreased margins</li>
<li>Decrease in the present income stream with resulting serviceability and (capitalised) valuation problems</li>
<li>Increased impact on serviceability where highly geared proposals are concerned</li>
<li>The potential impact of any of the above occurring at any time during the Bank’s exposure is to be considered at the time of credit assessment.</li>
</ul>
<span><span>Standard real estate includes houses, villas, units, vacant land zoned for residential use (up to 8 hectares) and others as defined in this policy.<br/>
We may also accept non-standard developments provided the customer meets certain conditions. Non-standard real estate is land or dwellings that are not typical for example: holiday resort-style accommodation or former commercial real estate converted into apartments.<br/>
For description or definition of each security type, refer to </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000601"><em> Glossary</em><em> </em></a><span><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000601">.</a><br/>
If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000600"><em> Lenders Mortgage Insurance </em> </a><span><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000600"> </a>where required.<br/>
 </span></span>
<h2><strong><span><span><span><a id="rule" name="rule"></a>2. Rules you must apply</span></span></span></strong></h2>
<h3><strong><span><span><span><a id="cert" name="cert"></a>2.1 Certificate of title</span></span></span></strong></h3>
 <span><span>The certificate of title is a certificate issued subject to the Real Property Act, which certifies that the person named therein as the registered proprietor has title to the land described in the certificate. The original title is retained by the Lands Titles Office.<br/>
When assessing property for its acceptability as security for a loan or loan variation we must obtain a title search to confirm root of title which includes identifying: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>The type of title</li>
<li>Who is the registered proprietor (the owner)</li>
<li>Any prior mortgage’s and their priority ranking</li>
<li>Any other restrictions or dealings registered on the title or lodged which could impact the Banks’ ability to register its mortgage or act on a mortgage once registered</li>
</ul>
<span><span>It is the responsibility of the assessor to obtain a copy of the title search and any dealings (registered or lodged) on the certificate of title prior to formal loan approval. The assessor must review the title search and any dealings to ensure the property is acceptable as security.<br/>
Assessor must confirm: </span></span>
<ul>
<li><span>Where the property is already owned, the owners as shown on the title search are exactly the same as the borrower’s (and any guarantor’s, if required); </span>or:</li>
<li><span>Where the property is being purchased, the vendor / transferrer as shown on the contract of sale and transfer description are exactly the same as the borrower’s (and any guarantor’s if required) </span></li>
</ul>
A purchase of a part ownership share in a property cannot be considered when all owners of the security offered, are not part of the loan application as either borrowers or guarantors. In all instances the borrowers / guarantors must own or be purchasing (in the new loan application) 100% of the property and have exclusive use and occupation entitlement of the property used as supporting security. <br/>
 
<div><span><span>Note: When the security is a company title (or Moiety title) the borrowers / guarantors must own or be purchasing 100% of the shares associated with the specific unit offered as security and have exclusive use and occupation entitlement. </span></span></div>
<br/>
When the property is under a leasehold title the borrowers / guarantors must be the same as the lessee, of the portion offered as supporting security and have exclusive use and occupation entitlement of the property used as supporting security. <br/>
<br/>
<span><span>With the exception of a second mortgage (refer to </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000606"> </a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000606#Assessing%20second%20mortgage">Assessing Loan to Value Ratio &gt; <em> Assessing second mortgage</em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000606"><em> </em></a><span><span>), the title must be free of any mortgages, caveats, restrictive encumbrances, writs, notifications or dealings that will not be removed prior to or simultaneously at loan settlement unless Credit have granted approval for any of these to remain on the title.<br/>
<br/>
If submitting a title to Credit to request approval for a mortgage, caveat, restrictive encumbrance, writ, notification or dealing to remain on title, then a copy of the title and dealing must be provided to Credit for review and consideration of any limitations the dealing may impose.<br/>
A copy of the title search and any dealing search are to be provided with the loan file.<br/>
Maximum age of a title search is 90 days.</span></span><br/>
 
<h4><a name="2.1.1 Second Mortgage behind other financial institution (OFI)"><strong>2.1.1 Second Mortgage behind other financial institution (OFI)</strong></a></h4>
<p>The Westpac Bank Group prefers to be the only mortgagee on a security property.  There may be some instances where we may take a second mortgage, for example, where the second mortgage is covering a shortfall in security by the primary property (eg Family Security Guarantee loan option).<br/>
 <br/>
A second mortgage may be taken where all the below are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The existing 1<sup>st</sup><span> </span>mortgage is not for a reverse mortgage styled facility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 1<sup>st</sup><span> </span>mortgagee is a Financial institution, i.e. is not a private mortgage provider. Private mortgage providers include but are not limited to an individual, a solicitor, vendor finance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LMI does not / will not apply to the proposed loan (LMI is not available for second mortgage scenarios where the first mortgage is not held by Westpac Bank)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second mortgage is being taken to cover a shortfall of security only and the primary security property is being taken by / or is already held with Westpac Bank Group registered as the 1<sup>st</sup><span> </span>mortgagee. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Details of the secured debts are verified as per<span> </span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/ci/okcsFattach/getFile/1000596/03.05%20Verifying%20Customer%20Commitments%20Matrix.xlsx">Commitments</a> policy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: St George (BOM and BSA) and RAMS are considered other financial institutions in terms of this policy.<br/>
Brokers should advise the applicant(s) that second mortgage scenarios may lead to longer settlement time frames that are outside of Westpac Bank Group’s control.  Delays can occur when we write to the prior mortgagee seeking consent to register the second mortgage and we ask the prior mortgagee to establish their priority amount.<br/>

<span><span>In NSW, owners have two options:<br/>
a) Under <strong><span>Option 1</span></strong></span></span><span><span>, homeowners will be offered the value of the whole property (land and improvements).<br/>
b) Under <strong><span>Option 2</span></strong></span></span><span><span>, homeowners will be offered the value of the whole property minus the value of the land. For rural properties, homeowners will be offered the value of the affected premises and any building or structures on its curtilage. The curtilage is the area, usually enclosed, that encompasses the grounds and buildings immediately surrounding the premises that are used in daily domestic activities. The effect of this process is that homeowners are offered the value of the affected premises by itself.<br/>
 <br/>
<strong><span>a) If the customer accepts option 1.</span></strong></span> </span>
<ol>
<li>Sale and discharge proceeds as normal.</li>
</ol>
<span><span> <br/>
<strong><span>b) If the customer accepts option 2.</span></strong></span> </span>
<ol>
<li>Customer is required as part of the scheme to provide ‘written confirmation from any financial institution that holds an interest over the property that acknowledges my/our intent to proceed with Option 2.’ to the scheme. ie Customer will contact Westpac to advise they have accepted option 2.</li>
<li>Consents team will receive customer notification and will acknowledge receipt to the customer.</li>
<li>Customer will then provide signed License Agreement to the Bank.</li>
<li>When the funds from the scheme are received, the loan balance and limit will be reduced to a maximum 80% of the land value indicated in the original NSW Government offer.</li>
<li>A new construction loan will be required once the customer has identified a builder. All normal lending criteria applies, and the new Progress Draw loan will be processed as normal.</li>

For the security to be acceptable the following conditions must be met: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>There is no current market for the sale and purchase of affected homes and therefore affected house / unit properties have a nil lending value until the building is demolished and removed.</li>
<li>Only the NSW Government agreed security value for the land is to be used as the security assessment. No other security assessment is to be relied on. The only exception to the acceptance of the land value is where customers wishes to purchase another property prior to receiving the purchase proceeds from the NSW Government and needs to fund all or part of the purchase price of the new property via a bridging loan from Westpac. The bridging loan should be processed with the following criteria:
	<ul>

<span><span>Homes for Homes (H4H) is a social housing initiative established by The Big Issue that will generate funds by encouraging developers and home owners to pledge a small percentage of the sale proceeds of their home (approx. 0.1%).<br/>
<br/>
Participation in the scheme is voluntary for our customers and they can opt-out at any time. The scheme has been rolled out to all states in Australia. To facilitate this process, the owners execute a Deed of Donation with Homes for Homes who lodge a permissive caveat on the title. To register a Transfer of Ownership or Mortgage, a consent from Homes for Homes will be required to be provided to the LTO with our settlement documents for lodgement.<br/>
The consent required by the LTO to accept the lodgement of our documents is specific to each state. To assist team members with understanding what information is required at settlement, a state based requirements Matrix has been created.<br/>
<br/>
Where our customer does not wish to donate, they can request the Withdrawal of Caveat from the charity, which will need to be provided at settlement if the customer would like the bank to lodge it as part of our lodgement documents.<br/>
