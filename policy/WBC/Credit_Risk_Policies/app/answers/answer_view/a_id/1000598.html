<h2><strong><span><span><span><a id="about" name="about"></a> 1. About this policy</span></span></span></strong></h2>
<h3><strong><span><span><span><a id="why" name="why"></a>1.1 Why this policy</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>This policy will help you determine when it is appropriate to provide a personal guarantee for mortgage applications.<br/>
This policy applies to loan applications that are wholly or partially secured by a personal guarantee.<br/>
  </span></span>
<h3><span><span><strong><span><a id="what is a gua" name="what is a gua"></a>1.2 What is a guarantee</span></strong><strong>?</strong></span></span></h3>
<span><span>A guarantee is a contractual promise given by a third party, i.e. the guarantor, who agrees to have a liability to pay for the loan if the customers are unable or unwilling to repay the loan.<br/>
The guarantor needs to seek independent legal advice to understand the implication of becoming a guarantor and must be interviewed separately in the absence of the borrower.<br/>
There are two types of guarantees which can be given by an individual guarantor: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Security (supported) guarantee: The guarantor’s security is used to support the loan application, i.e. the applicant should be able to service the proposed loan commitments, however requires assistance from a guarantor to provide a security. A guarantee is required from each mortgagor who is not a borrower for a particular facility.</li>
<li>Income (unsupported) guarantee: The guarantor’s income is used to support the loan application, i.e. the applicant’s capacity to service the loan commitments is dependent on the income of the guarantor. Reliance on income from a guarantor other than a married or de facto partner is unacceptable.</li>
</ul>
<span><span>If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to </span></span><a href="http://CHAPTER	ATTACHMENT	Answer ID	URL	Links Done 	links unable to find"><em> </em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000600"><em>Lenders Mortgage Insurance</em></a><a href="http://CHAPTER	ATTACHMENT	Answer ID	URL	Links Done 	links unable to find"><em> </em></a><span><span> where required</span></span><br/>
 
<h3><a id="1.3 Background - Guarantees" name="1.3 Background - Guarantees"><strong><span><span><span>1.3 Background - Guarantees</span></span></span></strong></a></h3>
<span><span>The National Credit Code (NCC) and the Banking Code of Practice (BCoP) provide protections to individuals who enter into a guarantee as security for a loan.<br/>
<br/>
The following is a summary of the broad principles regarding personal guarantees:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>In all instances, regardless of product whenever a guarantee is to be taken, we require<span> </span>guarantors to obtain independent legal advice before entering into a guarantee for all Security Guarantees, and recommend they obtain independent legal advice for all Income Guarantees (if both Security and Income Guarantee is taken, legal advice is required). The completed Guarantor’s Solicitor’s Certificate is to be provided to the Bank prior to settlement (i.e. release of loan funds) to evidence that independent legal advice has been received. Waiving of independent legal advice where it is mandatory under policy may only be approved by Consumer Bank Credit / Group Credit on exception basis.</li>
<li>In the case of a Security (supported) Guarantee, a guarantor's income cannot be used to assist in the assessment of the borrower’s ability to service the new loan. The borrower must be able to service the loan on their own, or by virtue of a company or trust completely controlled by the borrower alone.</li>
<li>In all instances, prospective guarantors are to be informed that they need to make any appropriate enquiries about the credit worthiness, financial position and integrity of the borrowers. This should be pointed out at application and again at approval. (The prospective guarantors are reminded of this prior to signing the Guarantee and Indemnity.)</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><a id="per guar scen" name="per guar scen"></a>2.1 Acceptable Guarantee Scenarios</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<p><span><span>For Consumer Lending policy, the Bank requires a guarantor to be an individual, an entity cannot be a guarantor. </span></span><br/>
<span><span>It is contrary to Bank policy to add a borrower and or guarantor for the purpose of increasing serviceability.</span></span><br/>
 <br/>
<span><span>Guarantees can be categorised as </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Trustee’s Guarantee</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Spousal Guarantee</span></span><span> </span></li>
<li><span><span>Family Security Guarantees</span></span></li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<span><span>The value ($) of the guarantee <strong><span>must</span></strong></span> be for the amount of credit (full loan amount) except for: </span>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Family Security guarantees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other exceptions approved by Credit which are limited to lending value required</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Acceptable Purposes:
				<ul>
<li>Purchase or refinance of:
					<ul>
<li> Owner Occupied - a property for own occupation where the borrower(s) have ownership of a maximum of one other property and the already owned property does not have sufficient equity to provide security for the new purchase without incurring mortgage insurance; or</li>
<li>Investment - a property for investment where the borrower(s) do not have ownership of any other property at time of application</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Construction by Licensed Builder (<strong><span>not</span></strong> available for Owner Builder construction)</li>

<li>Cash Out</li>
<li><span>Access to equity in the borrower’s property for the purpose of providing supporting security to another loan (via cross collateralisation or debt allocation /debt apportioning) while a Family Security Guarantee is in place.  If equity has been established in the borrower’s property, the borrower(s) are encouraged to release the Family Security Guarantee / guarantor’s security property.  Once the borrower is no longer receiving a benefit from a Family Security Guarantee, application processing can continue as per standard policy for home loan option and debt allocation may be considered.</span></li>

<p><span><span>Other guarantee proposals are generally <strong><span>not </span></strong></span></span><span><span>acceptable unless a direct benefit can be established.<br/>
			Requirements for establishing that the guarantor will receive a direct benefit will vary from one application to another. Westpac is required to demonstrate that the guarantor made a fully informed decision and will receive a measurable benefit that is comparable to the risk they are taking on. A financial benefit is the easiest to define and measure (e.g. the guarantor living in the property they are guaranteeing free of rent).

<p><span><span>Where the proposed loan is either wholly or in part secured by a Security and/or Income Guarantee, the prospective borrowers must be made aware of the following requirements at the time of the interview: </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Loans that involve individuals as Security guarantors are conditional on the guarantors obtaining independent legal advice and the Bank requires evidence that legal advice has been obtained. </li>
<li><span>Independent legal advice for loans involving an Income Guarantor is recommended but not mandatory. </span></li>
<li><span>The solicitor's cost is the responsibility of the guarantor (or borrower).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>Do not provide any advice in respect to the nature and effect of the guarantee.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><span>Note: </span></strong></span></span><span><span>Do not entrust the customer / borrower to act as Westpac's 'agent' to procure the guarantor's signature. Hand a copy of the Guarantor's Consent to Variation, Replacement or Alteration (LD164) to each guarantor. Alternatively, the consent form can be posted to the individual guarantor.</span></span></p>
<h3><span><span>  </span></span></h3>
<h3><strong><span><span><span><a id="prov ad to guar" name="prov ad to guar"></a>2.4 Providing advice to guarantors</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<p><span><span>The guarantor/s must be interviewed separately by the Broker without the borrower present.<br/>
At the interview, all prospective guarantors must be made aware of that: </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Independent legal advice and evidence of this advice is mandatory  for all Security Guarantees</p>
</li>
<li>It is recommended (however not mandatory) that legal advice is sought for Income Guarantees</li>
<li>
<p>There are financial risks involved in providing a guarantee, i.e. when the borrower is unable to the meet their financial obligations under the loan, the guarantor may need to pay for the debt commitments on behalf of the borrower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guarantor may request information about the proposed loan to be guaranteed.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong><span><span><span><a id="obtaining inde" name="obtaining inde"></a>2.5 Obtaining independent legal advice</span></span></span></strong></h3>

<h3><span><span> <br/>
<strong><span>Independence of the solicitor</span></strong></span></span></h3>
<p><span>The guarantor's solicitor must be independent of the Bank and the borrower, this includes: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The solicitor is not to be a solicitor for the Bank or for the borrower in the particular transaction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solicitor is not being a solicitor for any other interested party who might have previously given security. An example of an interested party is a guarantor who, having previously provided security, stands to benefit by way of reduced liability, from any additional security given by other guarantors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solicitor is not to be a partner of any solicitor who acts for the borrower or other interested party.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span><span>Exemption of independence rule</span></span></strong></h3>
<p><span><span>The solicitor can amend the certificate to signify that they also act for the borrower. Westpac, as a matter of policy exception, will generally accept the solicitor's certificate in such cases.<br/>
Exemption will <strong><span>not</span></strong></span> apply, for example, if: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A guarantor is open to influence by the others, <strong><span>or</span></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One guarantor is a spouse of the director who 'runs' the business, and is only involved in a formal manner or in some minor capacity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3> <br/>
<span><span> <br/>
<strong><span><a id="det undue inf" name="det undue inf"></a>Determining undue influence on the guarantor</span></strong></span></span></h3>
<p><span><span>If you know, or suspect, the guarantee relationship is one of dependency, reliance, or dominance, you must note in ApplyOnline comments so the Bank can insist on independent legal advice and a solicitor’s certificate. Otherwise, the courts might presume that there was undue influence and set aside the guarantee.<br/>
To help to determine whether there is undue influence, consider following questions: </span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Might anyone, in addition to the borrower, benefit from the guarantee being given?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span><span>This could include: </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Other individuals who have already given, or are about to give, guarantees (husband and wife)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the borrower is a trust, a beneficiary of the trust, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anybody else who has a significant direct or indirect interest in the borrower (e.g. shareholder)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li value="2">
<p>What is the nature of the relationship between the guarantor and any other benefited person?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span><span>With some relationships there is a presumption of undue influence no matter (e.g. solicitor and client; parent and dependent child; trustee and beneficiary; priest and parishioner; doctor and patient). With others it depends on individual circumstances.<br/>
Where a spouse is providing a guarantee, it is safer to strongly recommend a solicitor's certificate except where it is clear that the spouse is: </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Financially sophisticated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aware of the borrower's position</p>

The following is the process required to determine acceptability: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The supporting security property must have sufficient equity available, after taking into account any existing (prior) mortgages, guarantees, pledges or other liabilities, as well as the amount  of the Guarantee, to support a maximum total LVR that would not require LMI under the Bank’s normal LVR policy</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Confirm with the guarantor the total amount of any existing debts that may be secured by the guarantee property. The guarantor may need to consider not only the current balance of the primary loan they have outstanding, but any available redraw / unused credit limits, any prior  guarantees issued to other family members, business overdrafts or investment loans which may have been supported (cross-collateralised) against the guarantors security property.<br/>
	 
	<ul>
<li>Verify details of each of the guarantor/s commitments that are secured by guarantors property as per <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000596#ver%20cus%20com"><span><span>Commitments policy</span></span> &gt; verifying customer commitments &gt; commitment type</a>.  </li>
