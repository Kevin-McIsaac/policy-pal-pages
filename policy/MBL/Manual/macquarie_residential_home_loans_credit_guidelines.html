<h1>Residential Home Loans Credit Guidelines – Version 12.0</h1>
<h2>Guidelines Overview</h2>
<p>These guidelines set out credit parameters that Macquarie Bank considers when originating a residential home loan, specifically related to standard loans (residentially secured owner occupied and investment) and construction loans.</p>
<p>Macquarie Bank originates loans in Australian dollars and does not take 2nd registered mortgages behind other lenders.</p>
<p>Approval will be at the sole discretion of Macquarie Bank.</p>
<p>A conditional approval will be valid for 90 days from the time of approval. Once the loan is formally approved the loan must settle within 90 days from the time it was formally approved. If the applicant would like to proceed after the formal approval expires, it can be extended up to a maximum of 180 days from formal approval, subject to review of a completed &amp; signed Applicant Circumstance Change Declaration Form.</p>
<p>For any scenarios that do not meet these guidelines or questions, please contact your BDM for assistance.</p>
<p>These guidelines will be reviewed and updated from time to time in line with Macquarie Bank's risk appetite, market practice, and/or changes in regulation/legislation.</p>

<h1>Standard Loan Parameters</h1>
<p>The below guidelines apply to standard loans. i.e. residentially secured owner occupied, residentially secured investment.</p>
<p>Additional or varied parameters apply to non-standard loan types that are detailed in subsequent sections of the policy. This includes construction loans.</p>

<div class="sub-requirements">
<p>➢ Applies to both purchase and refinance applications.</p>
<p>➢ Applies to existing properties being used as collateral security to assist with a related purchase.</p>
<p>➢ For existing properties, ownership cannot be transferred as part of the loan application process to meet this minimum requirement i.e. it should be an established ownership structure that has been in place prior to the loan application or enquiry.</p>
<p>➢ Where more than 5 co-borrowers exist, ownership shares to be equal.</p>
<p>➢ Where more than 2 co-borrowers exist and 1 or more couples are evident, the minimum ownership requirement is to be applied to each couple and any individual borrowers (a couple being defined as 2 borrowers in a spousal relationship).</p>
</div>
<p>❑ Cash out and/or debt consolidation over and above any mortgage refinance amount is not allowed ($5,000 allowance can be granted for associated costs). The provision of funds for repairs/renovations to the security property can be considered only if the following requirements are met:</p>

<p>➢ Evidence of the purpose is provided via quotes/invoices/tender or a building contract; and</p>
<p>➢ All co-borrowers sign an undertaking/letter confirming the funds sought will be used for the renovations disclosed.</p>

<p>Credit analysts may at their discretion request statement(s) for a facility being refinanced to verify satisfactory repayment history. This is most likely to occur in situations where the credit report does not contain any repayment history information, or the credit analyst is prompted to undertake further investigation.</p>
<p>Where requested, statements should cover a 6 month period and show no more than 1 instance of a dishonoured/missed/late repayment or over the approved limit per loan application (not per account being refinanced) which was resolved in less than 30 days or by the next scheduled repayment. The most recent statement should be no more than 6 weeks old as at date of submission.</p>
<p>A bank statement can be considered acceptable where 6 full months' repayments have been observed. For example we have a loan statement on file for a loan to be refinanced where the statement period commences 1 July 2017 and ends 28 December 2017, the repayments to the loan are credited on the first business day of the month, as we can observe 6 months of loan repayments the bank statement is considered acceptable. Credit cards only require statements covering a 3 month period.</p>
<p>The following are examples of unsatisfactory repayment history;</p>
<ul>
<li>A facility being over the approved limit.</li>
<li>A missed loan repayment remains unpaid.</li>
<li>More than 1 dishonoured/missed/late repayment or over the approved limit during the last 6 months.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the loan statement only shows the charged interest amount every month and does not show the actual payments being made, statements are required for the transaction account showing the payments being made over the same period.</p>

<li>Declared living expenses are greater than or equal to 120% of the HEM benchmark; OR</li>

<li>Available redraw on existing loans can be considered where regular extra repayments have been made on the facility.</li>

<p>The higher of the carded rate plus assessment rate buffer or assessment rate floor is applied in servicing. The minimum assessment rate buffer is 3.00% with an assessment rate floor of 5.30%.

<p>For all repayment types (P&amp;I or Interest Only), serviceability is assessed using P&amp;I repayments. For loans with an interest only period, the P&amp;I repayment is calculated using the remaining loan term. For example, a 30 year loan with a 5 year interest only period, with be assessed using a 25 year P&amp;I repayment.</p>

</ol>
<p>Note in relation to option 2, where a YTD income statement covering a minimum 3-month period confirming the wage being paid from current business (not tax ready is acceptable) is provided, the verified figure can be annualised to determine income (capped at 120% of the total income figure verified in the personal tax return).</p>
<p>Note, where utilising this policy (either of the above options):</p>
<ul>
<li>The LVR must not exceed 80%; AND</li>
<li>No additional enquiry/documentation regarding the profitability of the trading entity is required; AND</li>
<li>The business must be trading for at least 12 months at time of application. Evidence of income received from the current business must also cover a minimum 12 month period at time of application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, in relation to options 1 and 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective 1st April each year, prior year documentation is required. There is a grace period of 2 weeks to allow for pipeline applications. However, after 15th April, prior year documentation is required.</li>

Notional rent can be excluded when the borrower is living rent free with their parents, so long as they are single and have no dependents.
