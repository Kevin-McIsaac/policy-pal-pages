<br/>
<span><span><span>For the purpose of this policy a commitment is any regular repayment which the applicant may have. Commitments may be referred to as a debt, liability or facility which may be secured or unsecured and also includes outgoing rent, board, child support (maintenance) payments and alimony (spousal support) payments.  </span></span></span> <span><span><span>The commitment may vary from payment to payment, like the minimum payment on a credit card or be fixed at a nominated amount, for instance a personal loan repayment with a fixed interest rate.</span></span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span><span>Excludes items which are captured within </span></span></span> <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000567"><em> Living Expenses </em></a> <span><span><span> policy.</span></span></span><br/>

<h3><strong><span><a id="A_Why this policy" name="A_Why this policy"></a><span><span>1.2 Why this policy</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<br/>
<span><span><span>This policy will help you in verifying an applicant's existing commitments and repayment conduct. This is a key part of the unsuitability assessment required for every applicant.  </span></span></span><br/>
<span><span><span>Verification of the applicant's commitments ensures accurate information is used in completing a financial assessment and serviceability calculation.</span></span></span><br/>
<span><span><span>Repayment history on existing debts is considered to be a critical indicator of an applicant's credit worthiness and ability to meet commitments.</span></span></span><br/>
<span><span><span>This policy is applicable where the loan activity is a:</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>New loan application</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Loan increase</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Any servicing/variation activity requiring a serviceability assessment</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to:</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000562"><em>Serviceability assessment </em></a></li>

<td>Where a borrower is experiencing difficulty paying their current commitments, they may enter into formal financial hardship arrangements with a credit or finance provider.  Poor conduct may occur even where such arrangements are in place.<br/>
<span><span>Identifying and reviewing performance of formal financial hardship arrangements applies to active commitments held by borrowers and / or income guarantors which are listed on the CCR bureau report. </span></span><br/>
<span><span>You are required to manually obtain and review the PDF version of the CCR bureau report to identify if the customer is specifically in temporary relief or has a deferral financial hardship arrangement in place <b>and </b>they are operating within the agreed arrangements. </span></span><br/>
<span><span>The ‘financial hardship arrangement check’ policy applies to commitments held with </span></span><span><span>both </span></span> <a href="#R_Rep His STG bank group defn"><span><span> St.George Bank Group </span></span></a> <span><span> (internal) or external parties and </span></span><span><span>for each commitment type which appears on the CCR and tells us how to complete a financial hardship arrangement check.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>A lender / assessor is unable to approve an application where an applicant is in temporary relief or a deferral financial hardship arrangement is in place. These applications <b>may</b> be referred to Credit for consideration if mitigants and additional supporting documents are provided. For example, details of the formal financial hardship arrangement. </span></span><br/>
<span><span>You can use the links below to navigate to the specific commitment type or scroll down the page to see the commitments listed in <a href="#R_Alphabetical listing"> alphabetical orde </a> r. Each commitment type will set out the requirements for verification.  </span></span>
