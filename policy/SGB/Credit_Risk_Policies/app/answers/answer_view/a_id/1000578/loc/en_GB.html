<td>Narrative</td>
<td>A transaction narrative is used to identify important information relating to credit or debit transactions on an account statement or account transaction listing, e.g. who the payment is to or from, reason for the payment etc.<br/>
			In some cases, the transaction narratives may be restricted by character count, where this occurs the narrative may only contain a partial description of the transaction.<br/>
			Where a single supporting document is used for verification, the transaction narrative must contain sufficient detail to clearly identify the transaction.<br/>
<b>Example </b>of an acceptable narrative where a single supporting document is used, may include, but is not limited to:
			<ul>
<li><span><span>Where verifying base salary credits to an account, the employer’s name in the narrative may appear partially or in full. To be acceptable the transaction narrative must be sufficient to be able to link the payment to the employer’s name entered in the loan application</span></span></li>
</ul>
			 <br/>
			Where a document(s) is used in combination with another document(s), a simpler narrative may be acceptable and must adhere to any requirements detailed in the specific policy.<br/>
<b>Example</b> of an acceptable narrative where documents are used in combination may include, but is not limited to:<br/>
<span><span><span>Where verifying income from a payslip and the supplied document is missing the ‘Period the payslip covers’ (e.g., weekly fortnightly, monthly), an internal system extract (account transaction listing) confirms the applicant is paid weekly.  The account transaction listing may have a simplified transaction narrative of ‘wages’.  </span></span></span></td>

<td><span><span>National Rental Affordability Scheme.<br/>
			A government backed incentive scheme that seeks to address the shortage of affordable rental housing by offering financial incentives to the business sector and community organisations to build and rent dwellings to low and moderate income households at lower levels compared to market rates. NRAS aims to increase the supply of new rental dwellings and improve rental affordability.<br/>
			There are two distinct NRAS structures:<br/>
<u>Head leases</u><br/>
			Some schemes operate on a head-lease structure where the scheme operator leases the property from the investor for a 10-year period and in turn sub-leases it to a qualifying tenant. Under this structure the investor has little or no control over the selection of tenants or the selection of the property manager (with the scheme operator generally taking care of both).<br/>
<u>Non-entity joint ventures (NEJV)</u><br/>
			Other schemes provide for the investor to select their own property manager and in turn enter into direct residential tenancy agreements with their tenants (and involve themselves in tenant selection).<br/>

			Common types of Trusts arrangements are: </span></span>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Bare Trust</span></strong>: A trust where there is no trust deed. This type of trust commonly arises from a single transaction (e.g. used when a superannuation fund is purchasing a property)</li>
<li><strong><span>Discretionary Trust</span></strong>: The trustee has discretion as to how Trust income and assets are distributed between beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are usually described by reference to a certain criteria. Generally it is not possible to identify all of the potential beneficiaries until the date of termination of the trust. The most common example of a Discretionary Trust is a family trust.</li>
<li><strong><span>Unit Trust:</span></strong> The beneficiaries hold units in the trust, Trust funds and assets can be distributed according to the unit holdings. The unit holders can be easily determined at any given time. Unit Trust can be listed or unlisted.</li>

<strong><span>Change 3 </span></strong><br/>
<strong><span>Added new definition for ‘Narrative’ </span></strong><br/>
			A transaction narrative is used to identify important information relating to credit or debit transactions on an account statement or account transaction listing, e.g. who the payment is to or from, reason for the payment etc.<br/>
			In some cases, the transaction narratives may be restricted by character count, where this occurs the narrative may only contain a partial description of the transaction.<br/>
			Where a single supporting document is used for verification, the transaction narrative must contain sufficient detail to clearly identify the transaction.<br/>
<b>Example </b>of an acceptable narrative where a single supporting document is used, may include, but is not limited to:

			<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Where verifying base salary credits to an account, the employer’s name in the narrative may appear partially or in full. To be acceptable the transaction narrative must be sufficient to be able to link the payment to the employer’s name entered in the loan application</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
			Where a document(s) is used in combination with another document(s), a simpler narrative may be acceptable and must adhere to any requirements detailed in the specific policy.<br/>
<b>Example</b> of an acceptable narrative where documents are used in combination may include, but is not limited to:<br/>
<span><span><span>Where verifying income from a payslip and the supplied document is missing the ‘Period the payslip covers’ (e.g., weekly fortnightly, monthly), </span></span></span> <span><span><span> an internal system extract (account transaction listing) confirms the applicant is paid weekly.  The account transaction listing may have a simplified transaction narrative of ‘wages’ <span>.  </span></span></span></span></td>
