<h2><strong><span><span><span><a id="ab" name="ab"></a> 1. About this policy</span></span></span></strong></h2>
<h3><a id="why" name="why"></a><span><span><strong><span><span><span>1.1 Why this policy</span></span></span></strong></span></span></h3>
 <span><span>This policy will give you an overview of all acceptable guarantee scenarios, including the Family Pledge Home Loan Option, and the requirements for each scenario.</span></span>
<h3><strong><span><span><span><a id="what" name="what"></a>1.2 </span></span><span><span>What is a guarantee?</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>A guarantee is a contractual promise given by a third party, i.e. the guarantor, who agrees to have a liability to pay for the loan if the customer(s) is/are unable or unwilling to repay the loan.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span><span>A Security guarantor is when the borrower will not or does not own 100% of the security property offered to support the loan. The guarantor is providing security to support the loan only and not providing income to boost loan serviceability.  </span></span></span><br/>
 
<h3><a id="Background - Guarantees" name="Background - Guarantees"><strong><span><span>1.3 Background - Guarantees</span></span></strong></a></h3>
<span><span><span>The National Credit Code (NCC) and the Banking Code of Practice (BCoP) provide protections to individuals who enter into a guarantee as security for a loan.<br/>
<br/>
The following is summary of the broad principles regarding personal guarantees:<br/>
For details of BCoP requirements relating to Guarantees, refer to </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Banking Code of  Practice (BCoP</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>). </span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>In all instances, regardless of product, whenever a guarantee is to be taken, we require guarantors to obtain independent legal advice before entering into a guarantee. The completed <em>Guarantor’s Solicitor’s Certificate</em> is to be provided to us prior to settlement (i.e. release of loan funds) to evidence that independent legal advice has been received. Waiving of independent legal advice may only be approved by Consumer Bank Credit / Group Credit on exception basis.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>A guarantor's income cannot be used to assist in the assessment of the borrower’s ability to service the new loan. The borrower must be able to service the loan on their own, or by virtue of a company or trust completely controlled by the borrower alone.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>In all instances, prospective guarantors are to be informed that they need to make any appropriate enquiries about the credit worthiness, financial position and integrity of the borrowers. This should be pointed out at application and again at approval. (The prospective guarantors are reminded of this prior to signing the Guarantee and Indemnity.)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span> If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, you may also need to refer to </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000381"><em> </em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000579"><em>Lenders mortgage insurance (LMI)</em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000381"><em> </em></a><span><span> for further information.<br/>

<h2><strong><span><span><span><a id="rules" name="rules"></a>2. Rules you must apply</span></span></span></strong></h2>
<h3> <a id="2.1 Acceptable guarantors and guarantee scenarios" name="2.1 Acceptable guarantors and guarantee scenarios"></a><strong><span><span><span>2.1 Acceptable guarantors and guarantee scenarios</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span><span>For Consumer Lending policy, the Bank requires a guarantor to be an individual, an <a><span>entity</span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span> cannot be a guarantor. </span></span></span><br/>
<span><span><span>It is contrary to Bank’s policy to add a borrower and or guarantor for the purpose of increasing serviceability.</span></span></span><br/>
 <br/>
<span><span><span>In some scenarios the guarantor of a loan may share common debts with the borrower. In the first instance test if the borrower can service 100% of the common debt without the guarantor’s income. If the borrower cannot service 100% of the common debt, and the </span></span></span><a><span><span><span>Security</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> Guarantor will also need to act as a Common Debt Reducer, refer to </span><span>Serviceability Assessment &gt; Common Debt Reducer (CDR)</span><span> for additional requirements.  </span></span></span> <br/>
 <br/>
<span><span><span>Where the Security Guarantor is not a Common Debt Reducer, income verification is not required, and the Security Guarantor must not be included in the serviceability assessment.</span></span></span><br/>
 <br/>
<strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> A Credit Bureau check is not to be completed on a security guarantor</span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span><br/>

<h3><span><span><a id="2.2 Guarantee amount" name="2.2 Guarantee amount"><strong><span><span>2.2 Guarantee amount</span></span></strong></a></span></span></h3>
<a><span><span><span>Apart from the Family Pledge Home Loan option, which can be limited to an agreed amount lesser than the full loan amount, all other security guarantees will require a guarantee for the full loan amount. </span></span></span></a><br/>
 <br/>
<strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span>Under NCC a</span></span><span><span> guarantee can secure an amount that does not exceed the sum of the borrower’s liabilities, plus reasonable expenses of enforcing the guarantee, or any lesser amount agreed between us and the guarantor. BCoP also requires a guarantee to limit the guarantor’s liability.</span></span>
<h3> <a id="2.3 Un-acceptable Guarantors" name="2.3 Un-acceptable Guarantors"></a><strong><span><span><span>2.3 Unacceptable Guarantors</span></span></span></strong></h3>
 <span><span>The following are unacceptable guarantors:</span></span>

<li>Temporary Australian residency visa holder (refer to <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000564"><em> Migrant Lending Policy </em></a>)</li>
<li>Entities</li>
<li><span><span><span>Unsupported guarantees (apart from a director’s guarantee when the company is borrowing)</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Director’s guarantee from an unrelated company</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Any guarantee structure not identified as acceptable in this policy</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Also refer to Personal Guarantee Scenarios &gt; </span></span><span><span>Unacceptable scenarios.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="2.4 Guarantor interview" name="2.4 Guarantor interview"></a><strong><span><span><span>2.4 Guarantor interview</span></span></span></strong></h3>
 <span><span><span>The guarantor must be interviewed separately in the absence of the borrower.</span></span></span>
<h3><strong><span><span><a id="2.5 Independent Legal Advice" name="2.5 Independent Legal Advice">2.5 Independent Legal Advice </a> </span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span><span>We require a guarantor to obtain independent legal advice to understand their obligations and liability under the guarantee.</span></span></span>
<h3><a id="2.6 Accepting a guarantee - 3 day requirement" name="2.6 Accepting a guarantee - 3 day requirement"><strong><span><span>2.6 Accepting a guarantee - 3 day requirement</span></span></strong></a></h3>
<span><span><span>The guarantor must be provided with the following:</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>The terms and conditions of the guarantee</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Any notice of demand we have made on the borrower in the past two years</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>A copy of the borrower’s loan contract</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>A copy of the borrower’s credit report</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>A copy of the borrower’s financial accounts or statements held in the last two years for the guaranteed loan.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>A copy of any other information the guarantor reasonably requests about the guaranteed loan.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span>We <strong>must not accept the returned, signed guarantee document before 3 days has passed</strong>. The intention is to allow the guarantor time to consider the guarantee they are about to provide. </span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span><span>Exceptions to the 3 day rule are as follows: </span></span></span> 

<ul>
<li><span><span><span>If the guarantor has obtained independent legal advice and provided evidence</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>If the guarantor is acting as trustee for a trust on the loan application</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>If the borrower is a company and the guarantee provided is from the company director. </span></span></span><br/>

<h3><a id="2.7 Security Guarantor" name="2.7 Security Guarantor"><strong><span><span><span>2.7 Security Guarantor </span></span></span></strong></a></h3>
	 <br/>
<a><span><span><span>A Security guarantor is required when the borrower will, or does not, own 100% of the security property offered to support the loan</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>.  For SBG, the most common Security Guarantee type is the Family Pledge Home Loan option, however a security guarantee from the borrower’s spouse is also permitted.</span></span></span><br/>

<span><span><span>A Security Guarantee from a co-owner of an existing real estate property, that is not spousal, is outside a lender’s authority to approve.

<span><span><span>Unless the Security Guarantor is also a Common Debt Reducer, income verification is not required, and the Security Guarantor must not be included in the serviceability assessment.

It will be a single loan or a Flexible Choice (multi-sequence) loan, secured by the borrower’s property as the primary (1st) security in all cases, with a limited, Security Guarantee (“Family Pledge”) from acceptable family members, supported by a registered first mortgage over the family member’s property or a registered second mortgage.<br/>
<strong><span>Note: </span></strong></span>When the Family Pledge (limited supported guarantee amount) is insufficient to bridge the gap between the loan amount sought by the borrower(s) and the value extended against the borrower's security property, the application may be considered for mortgage insurance.

</li>
<li>The guarantee is structured so that the guarantor’s liability is limited to a specified amount and, at the request of either the borrower or the guarantor at any time during the loan term, they can ask to be released from the guarantee. The Bank will consider each request, but generally only if, at the time of the request the repayments for all borrower's loans are satisfactory and, the loan balance (and LVR) is reduced to the level where LMI is not required or where the borrower is prepared to pay a LMI premium. (subject to LMI assessment and approval) This policy requirement gives borrowers and guarantor’s certainty as to the limit of the guarantee.</li>
<li>The guarantor will also be informed that, in terms of the Banking Code of Practice, the bank will not take action under that guarantee unless and until action against the borrower has been unsuccessful.  The Bank will not, under a Guarantee, enforce a judgment against the guarantor unless:
				<ul>
<li>we have obtained judgment against the principal debtor for payment of the guaranteed liability which has been unsatisfied for 30 days after we have made written demand for payment of the judgment debt; or</li>
<li>we have made reasonable attempts to locate the debtor without success; or</li>

<p><span><span><span>If the original application <strong>was not</strong> mortgage insured and the resulting LVR requires LMI, the application will require re-origination and will be subject to a full assessment and new documentation. The mortgage insurer will need to consider the borrower’s suitability. For maximum LVR’s with LMI refer to </span></span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000555" target="_blank"><em><span><span><span><span>LVR table</span></span></span></span></em></a><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The guarantee can be released at the borrower or guarantor’s request. The borrower or guarantor may request a revaluation of the borrower’s property at any time, subject to the payment of the requisite valuation fee at the time of the request. A short form valuation of the borrower’s security property will be required to confirm the LVR of the borrower’s loan. Providing the LVR is under the prevailing LMI threshold(s) or the required LMI premium is paid, the guarantee and the mortgage that supports it, can be released, providing the above conditions are met.</span></span></span></p>

<h2><strong><span><span><span><a id="fre a qu" name="fre a qu"></a>8. Frequently Asked Questions</span></span></span></strong></h2>
<div><span><span>The following are common questions regarding Family Pledge Home Loan option.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><span>Q1.</span></strong></span> Customer’s C &amp; D want to buy an owner occupier property using the Family Pledge home loan option. Customer C &amp; D already have 3 investment property loans. Are we able to proceed? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A1.</span></strong></span><span> No, the applicants exceed the maximum number of already owned properties.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q2.</span></strong></span><span> The guarantor has an owner occupier property and an investment property. They only want to offer the investment property as security for the Family Pledge. However, this will result in the pledge against the Investment property exceeding 50% of its value. Can I proceed? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A2.</span></strong></span><span> This transaction would be outside of a lenders authority to approved, and you would need to discuss the application with your dedicated Credit contact. Credit may consider the transaction where sufficient mitigants exist.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q3. </span></strong></span><span>Policy says that the applicants can have a property for own occupation if the applicants already have a property. Does that mean they can have one each and still get a Family Pledge? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A3. </span></strong></span><span>No. If the combined number of properties the applicants already have (partial or full ownership) is greater than one they are not eligible for a family pledge. The intent of the product is to help people enter the property market, not build an investment property portfolio.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q4.</span></strong></span><span> If my customer is applying for a Family Pledge Home Loan option, can they also have mortgage insurance? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A4</span></strong></span><span>. The intent of the product option is to maximise the amount the applicant can borrow without the requirement for mortgage insurance. However in some cases where warranted and where the applicant qualifies mortgage insurance may be an option.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q5.</span></strong></span><span> If the Family Pledge Home Loan option is being approved with Mortgage Insurance what LVR is available against both the guarantors property and the borrowers property? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A5</span></strong>. </span><span><span><span>Mortgage insurance may be available for the borrower’s property, refer to <span>Assessing Loan to Value Ratio</span> policy for the maximum LVR applicable for the type of security property offered.  Mortgage insurance is not available for guarantor’s property</span></span></span><span>.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q6.</span></strong></span><span> The proposed guarantor(s) for the transaction are the applicant’s parents and grandparents. Is this acceptable? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A6. </span></strong></span><span>Grandparents are unacceptable guarantors. Refer to<a href="#unacc fam"> </a></span><a href="#unacc fam"><em> Unacceptable Family Pledge Guarantors </em></a><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q7.</span></strong></span><span> If the guarantor is the applicant step- mother or step- father and they are the sole owner of the guarantee property, is this acceptable. (i.e. the biological parent is not part of the transaction) </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A7. </span></strong></span><span>Yes, this is an acceptable scenario.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q8.</span></strong></span><span> Policy states that no single guarantee is to represent more than 50% of the guarantor’s security. What happens if the guarantor wants to help multiple children? Is the total sum of all of guarantees issued able to exceed 50% of the security value? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A8.</span></strong></span><span> This scenario can be considered. You will need to ensure you do not exceed the maximum LVR permitted against the guarantors security.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q9.</span></strong></span><span> I’ve reviewed the Family Pledge Home Loan option, but my guarantor is unable to meet the criteria. Can I just take an unlimited guarantee from the guarantor to link in their security property? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A9. </span></strong></span><span>No, this is not an acceptable alternative. If the guarantor is unable to meet the eligibility criteria then the transaction cannot proceed. The guarantor is protected by the NCC and BCoP, which require a guarantee to be limited to the sum of the borrower's liabilities, plus reasonable expenses reinforcing the guarantee, or any lesser amount agreed between the bank and the guarantor.</span><br/>
<br/>
<strong><span><span>Q10.</span></span></strong><span><span> Where the guarantor is offering a pledge supported by a Second Mortgage security, is this restricted to a major bank lender or are 2<sup> nd </sup> or 3<sup> rd </sup> tier lenders acceptable? </span></span><br/>
<strong><span><span>A10. </span></span></strong><span><span>The repayment of the debt is based on the strength of our applicant. The guarantor’s lender does not reflect on the credit worthiness of the applicant. Be aware that 2<sup> nd </sup> mortgages are not permitted where the 1<sup> st </sup> mortgage is a private mortgage provider </span></span><span lang="EN-GB">or where the first mortgage is not held within the St George,/BOM / BSA (Westpac and RAMS are considered external mortgage)</span><span><span>.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q11.</span></strong></span><span> My customer banks with another financial institution. They want to refinance to us and get some equity out of their property. Can we offer them a Family Pledge Home Loan option? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A11. </span></strong></span><span>No. Refer to </span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000558"><em> </em><em>Eligibility - Family Pledge Home Loan option </em></a><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q12</span></strong></span><span>. My customer (A) is with SBG at present they have a variable rate, joint home loan with customer (B), but the relationship has dissolved, </span><strong><span>there is no</span></strong><span> Family Pledge in place today. Customer (B) is to be released from the borrowing and Customer (A) wants to refinance the security property and Home Loan into their own name. Customer (A) is able to service the loan in their own right, but they are asking if they can have a Family Pledge Home Loan option now. Is this possible? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A12.</span></strong></span><span> As per </span><a href="#el fam"><em> Eligibility - Family Pledge Home Loan option</em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000558"><em> </em></a><span><span>, this is an acceptable exception scenario. </span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q13.</span></strong></span><span> My customers borrowed to purchase vacant land using the Family Pledge Home Loan option. The loan product they took was a fixed rate. They are now ready to borrow for the build. They need to increase the family pledge, but don’t want to refinance the existing debt because it would incur Break Costs. What do I do? </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>A13. </span></strong></span><span>Refer to </span><a href="#el fam"><em> Eligibility - Family Pledge Home Loan option</em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000558"><em> </em></a><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong><span>Q14.</span></strong></span><span> Can my customer increase their loan with an existing Family Pledge in place? </span><br/>
<strong><span><span>A14.</span></span></strong><span><span> There are limited scenarios where increases may be considered provide dthe existing family pledge is not increased, r</span>efer to </span><a href="#el fam"><em> Eligibility - Family Pledge Home Loan option </em></a><span><span>.</span></span></div> </div> </div>
