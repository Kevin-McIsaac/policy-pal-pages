 </h2>
<h3><strong><span><span><a id="assessing" name="assessing"></a>2.1 Assessing self-employed applications </span></span></strong></h3>
<br/>
 <span><span>Assessing self-employed applicants is different from assessing PAYG applicants for a number of key reasons as follows: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Salary or drawings taken from a business by a self-employed applicant may not reflect the underlying sustainable earnings capability of the business. The owner may be draining the business of its reserves by paying him/herself an inflated salary, over and above what the business can afford.</li>
<li>The earnings of a self-employed applicant may vary significantly from year to year depending on business cycles and how well the business is performing. Significant variations may affect the applicant's ability to repay the loan and therefore the variability of income is to be included as part of the assessment process.</li>
<li>Private and business expenses can become intermingled.</li>
<li>Self-employed people have a greater opportunity to adjust their income to indicate servicing capacity that may not exist.</li>
<li>Self-employed people may have a number of sources of income that have to be taken into account when assessing their capacity to service.</li>
</ul>
<span><span>A separate process is necessary for self-employed applications to:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>Determine real income available for loan servicing</li>
<li>Ensure an appropriate legal structure for the loan</li>
<li>Ensure appropriate security arrangements for the loan</li>
</ul>
 <br/>
<span><span>An application may be impacted by more than one scenario contained in:</span></span>
<ul>
<li><a href="#app by borrower type"><em>2.1.1 Applications by borrower type </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#app by income"><em>2.1.2 Applications by income source </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#self emplo"><em>2.1.3 Self-employed activity has made a loss </em><strong><em>or</em></strong><em> it has been identified it cannot service its commitments on its own</em> </a></li>

<p><span><span>Where the borrower is both a current company director and a shareholder, and owns a controlling interest in a company* (i.e. </span></span>≥50% <span><span>shareholding), currently and for the two financial years (or one year where acceptable to use one year's financials, e.g. Medico) being assessed; <strong>and</strong> there is a shortfall in serviceability from the borrowers’ individual incomes, undistributed company earnings may be added to the borrowers’ incomes, <strong>only proportionate to the level of ownership held</strong>.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>To establish that the borrower(s) has met the eligibility criteria for use of undistributed company profits, the broker should complete a company search and review the search to confirm the borrower(s):</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Is a current director</li>
<li>Currently holds ≥50% shareholding in the company</li>
<li>Was a director and ≥50% shareholder in the company for the two financial years being assessed (including where backdated), (or one year where acceptable to use one year’s financials, e.g. Medico)</li>
</ul>
<span><span>Refer to <a href="#Completing business name or company searches"><em>Completing business name or company searches</em></a></span></span><a href="#Completing business name or company searches"><span><span> </span></span></a><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>The broker is to record comments in the assessment system confirming the above and submit the company search and any relevant document search relating to a change(s) to directorship and/or shareholding with the application supporting documents.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>The borrower(s) will be ineligible to use undistributed company profit where they are not currently a director and ≥50% shareholder, have been added as a director and /or shareholder or their shareholding has increased to ≥50% (including where backdated), during the two financial years (or one year where acceptable to use one year’s financials, e.g. Medico) used in the serviceability assessment.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>Where it is evident over the two financial years (or one year where acceptable to use one year’s financials, e.g. Medico) used in the serviceability assessment or in the period preceding loan application submission, that a borrower’s shareholding in a company:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>Meets the minimum 50% ownership requirement, but has increased (e.g. FY19 50% shareholding and FY20 70% shareholding), then the lower historical shareholding ownership percentage (e.g. 50%) of the banks calculated adjusted net profit after tax &amp; repayments may be used in serviceability assessment</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Has decreased from ≥50% to &lt; 50%, then unable to use company profit in the serviceability assessment.  Where the company is making a loss, the loss however must still be included in the serviceability assessment, refer to <em><a href="#self emplo">Self-employed activity has made a loss or if it has been identified it cannot service its commitments on its own </a></em></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span><sup>#</sup>Where there is more than 1 borrower and the borrowers combined have &gt;=50% shareholding, they are eligible to use undistributed company profit to their combined ownership % amount.  This is not a policy exception.</span></span></p>

<p>For all loan applications using undistributed company profits in serviceability, the impacts to the company must be discussed with the borrower(s) and documented in the loan assessment notes.

<p><span><span>Where the borrower is both a current company director <strong><span>and</span></strong></span> a shareholder currently, and for the two financial years being assessed (or one year where acceptable to use one year’s financials, e.g. Medico) <strong><span>and</span></strong></span> there is a shortfall in serviceability from the borrowers' individual incomes, the dividend received from own company may be added to the borrowers' income, <strong><span>only proportionate to the level of ownership / shareholding held</span></strong><span><span>.<br/>
<br/>
			To establish that the borrower has met the eligibility criteria for use of the dividend, the broker must complete a company search and review the search to confirm the borrower: </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Is a current director <strong><span>and</span></strong></li>
<li>Was a director and shareholder in the company for the two financial years being assessed (if the shareholding % has changed , including where backdated, the lowest % shareholding during the assessment period applies), or one year where acceptable to use one year’s financials (e.g. Medico)</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<span><span>Care must be exercised when considering dividend payments. </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>A Franking credit must not be added to the dividend. A franking credit is unacceptable income</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm the dividend payment has been paid regularly each year. Review past two years tax returns for the individual to confirm receipt  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm the dividend has been paid out of current year company profits in each financial year used in the serviceability assessment <strong><span>and not out</span></strong> of retained profits carried forward from previous years</p>
</li>
<li>Confirm the dividend is not related to a "once" off event for example, capital gain via sale of an asset.</li>
<li>Dividends paid must be traced back to the original earning entity to ensure the dividend received does not exceed the banks calculated 'Adjusted net profit after tax and repayments'. <span><span>Note : the lower of the 2 year average actual dividend received or the director / shareholders % of the Adjusted net profit after tax and repayments' figure must be used in serviceability</span></span></li>

<h3><a><span><span><strong>Definition</strong></span></span></a><span><span><span> </span></span></span></h3>
<span><span><span><span>Depreciation is an accounting method </span></span><span><span>for</span></span><span><span> allocating the cost of a tangible or physical asset over its </span></span><span><span>useful life</span></span><span><span> or life expectancy. Depreciation represents how much of an asset's value has been used up. </span></span><span>Depreciation 'expenses' are generally considered not direct costs to the business, hence cash-flow should be available to meet loan repayments.</span></span></span><br/>
<span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Depreciation is not an acceptable addback for a Trust entity,  given the manner in which a trust utilises depreciation is quite unique and not comparable to other entity types. As a result of the method used by a trust to disburse profits to its beneficiaries, we cannot accurately determine if a beneficiary received a monetary benefit from the depreciation.  </span></span><br/>

<p><span><span>A Superannuation guarantee cost is only compulsory to a Sole Trader, Partnership that has an external employee or under a company structure.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Though it is not compulsory for self-employed applicants to contribute towards superannuation, in some instances applicants do make large bulk payments to such funds. Owners of companies often make contributions on their own behalf in excess of the statutory superannuation guarantee amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superannuation guarantee cost is assessed as a percentage of the salary and the directors fees (in the case of a company) paid to the employees and company director(s). The amount of any contribution made in excess of the statutory requirement may be used as an add-back. This will only be considered appropriate when the Profit and Loss statement clearly shows payments were made on behalf of the applicants and not the employees and it can be demonstrated that the excess contributions are not required to service any Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) borrowings that the self-employed applicant may have.</p>

<strong><a id="fast track self-employed assessment" name="fast track self-employed assessment"></a>2.4 Fast track self-employed assessment </strong></h3>
<p><span><span>Fast Track assessment is a simple Self-Employed income assessment method relying on the applicants 2 year’s personal Australian Taxation Office (ATO) Notice of Assessments (NOA's).<br/>
To assess income under the Self-employed Fast Track income verification method:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>The </span></span><span><span>eligibility criteria</span></span><span><span> must be met. </span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Income from the self-employed applicant is to be verified completely from the applicants personal ATO NOA’s, i.e. no further self-employed income documentation (within age of documentation requirements) is required or is to be held or requested, where servicing is met using income from the ATO NOA's.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>An ABN search must be performed on all associated self-employed entities to confirm a minimum of two full financial years self-employment. Refer to <a href="#Completing business name or company searches">Completing ABN, business name or company searches</a></span></span><a href="#Completing business name or company searches"><span><span> </span></span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>If the applicant is self-employed and also has a second completely independent PAYG job, the PAYG income will also be verified from the ATO NOA’s only. If the PAYG employment commenced after the period covered by the ATO NOAs, and the income is required for serviceability assessment, then Fast Track is <strong>not</strong> available and one of the </span></span><a href="#2.2.1 Income verification Self-Employed standard assessment – 2 year average"><em><span><span><span>F</span></span></span></em><em><span><span><span>ully verified self-employed assessment</span></span></span></em></a><span><span> policies must be used. </span></span><br/>
<span><span>The <strong>only</strong> exception where income can be considered </span></span><span><span>that is not captured in the </span></span><span><span>ATO NOA’s </span></span><span><span>held</span></span><span><span>is rental income, where the rental income commenced after the financial years covered by the ATO NOA’s </span></span><span><span>provided</span></span><span><span>. In this instance investment property expenses must be identified and included in-line with </span></span><span><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000567">Living Expenses</a> </span></span><span><span>policy.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>When the applicant has investment properties that earned rental income during the ATO NOA period (either part of, or the entire period), then it is acceptable to load a $0 investment property expense for this real estate, as the expenses are already captured in the ATO NOA taxable income figure.  In this scenario the following comment, or similar, must be entered as the $0 expense explanation:</span></span><br/>
<em><span><span>“Nil investment property expenses captured as the rental property was owned during the period covered by the ATO NOAs (or part thereof), and the rental expenses are factored into the total taxable income figure sourced from the ATO NOA.”</span></span></em><br/>
 <br/>
<span><span><strong>Notes</strong>: </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>When a property is only rented for part of the period covered by the ATO NOA’s no annualisation of rental income is permitted under Fast Track and there is no expectation to load additional investment property expenses.  If rental income of this nature requires annualisation for the serviceability assessment then Fast Track is <strong>not</strong> available and one of the <a href="https://westpacgroup-my.sharepoint.com/personal/m716960_westpacgroup_com/Documents/_MyHome/Documents/OKA/Policy%20updates/3%20October%202021/RRB/RRB%2003.16%20Self%20Employed%20Applicants%20V0.8%20TA.docx#R_Fully-verified_standard_self-employed"><em><span>F</span></em></a><a href="#2.2.1 Income verification Self-Employed standard assessment – 2 year average"><em><span>ully verified self-employed assessment</span></em></a> policies must be used.</li>
<li>When the ATO NOA shows franking credits, no adjustment of the taxable income is required to account for the franking credit. A franking credit must not be added to or subtracted from the Taxable income figure.</li>
<li><span><span>When serviceability is assessed under the Fast Track method, a self-employed entity (e.g. company or trust) must not be included separately in the serviceability assessment,  and verification of any commitments related to the company and/or Trust (with corporate trustee) is not required.</span></span></li>

<p><span><span>To determine if an applicant is an owner or part owner of a Company a broker should review the applicants Credit Bureau report. This credit bureau report will show any related directorships. </span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>While the Directors of the company have responsibility for the day to day management, we need to also consider who the shareholders are of the company when determining what income we can use in the loan assessment, i.e. share of profit based on being a director and percentage of shareholding. A company search will reflect the applicants current Shareholding of that entity, in addition to documenting any change(s) to shareholders and/or shareholdings since establishment of the company, where applicable.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>If the related entity is to a business trading name (e.g. Bluey’s convenience store) but not a company (e.g. Blue Star Pty Ltd), then a business name search will reflect the applicant's relationship to the business.</span></span><br/>

<span>An ABN search can confirm if the ABN is active, how long the ABN has been active and the GST registration status. Complete an ABN search using </span><span>ABN Look-up via </span> <span><a href="http://www.abr.business.gov.au/"><em><span>www.abr.business.gov.au</span></em></a></span><span> . </span></p>
<p>When the application is assessed under Fast Track, an ABN search is required on all self-employed entities the applicant derives an income from, to confirm the self-employed entities have been established and trading for a minimum of two full financial years.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: only the ABN search is required under Fast Track, a company directorship search is not required.</p>

<h3><a id="5. Guide to understanding changes to business profitability and recording supporting rationale" name="5. Guide to understanding changes to business profitability and recording supporting rationale"><span><strong><span>5. Guide to understanding changes to business profitability and recording supporting rationale for fully verified - latest year income assessment</span></strong></span></a></h3>
It is best practice to record factors relating to the assessment of self-employed / business income in all cases, regardless of whether the file is approved within your authority ( OVA ) or is escalated to Credit for consideration. <br/>
When assessing serviceability based on the latest year self-employed income and the two years average income is &gt;130% of the prior years income, it is mandatory to review the business financials and to enter supporting comments to explain:
<ul>
<li>Why there has been a change from the prior year</li>
<li>How  the change to business profit is sustainable into the future</li>
<li>Why the income can be used for serviceability assessment.</li>
</ul>
<span><span><span> Supporting comments should refer to the appropriate items in the financials/tax returns where possible and may also be supported by customer conversations and additional supporting documents if appropriate. </span></span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>There are many factors which can affect the profitability of business income / self-employed applicants. This guide outlines some common scenarios which may be the reason for the change in profitability.  </span></span><br/>
<span><span>It is not an exhaustive list of scenarios and each source of self-employed income will have its own unique story.  These scenarios are provided to help guide you to have an insightful conversation with the borrower about why the business has experienced changes to profitability.  </span></span><br/>
<br/>
<strong><span><span>Scenarios</span></span></strong><br/>
<strong><span><span>When reviewing the financial information provided by the borrower if the latest year’s income is higher than the prior year’s income, we should try to identify if the change is due to a reduction in expenses or an increase in sales? </span></span></strong>

<p><b>Increase in sales<b>   </b> </b></p>
<p>When the increase in net profit is due to an increase in sales, a lender / assessor must understand how this increase occurred and if this is sustainable.   </p>
<p>In addition to understanding how a business has increased the net profit, a lender / assessor should also consider potential industry or market changes that are likely to have an adverse impact on the business. To use an extreme example, during COVID-19 many restrictions were imposed which had a severe impact to industries such as tourism, retail, and hospitality, just to name a few.</p>

The new product / service has proven to be very popular and has resulted in higher trade, with trends in trade showing no signs of slowing demand.</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td><span>The business increased the price of its goods / services. </span></td>
<td>
<p>Is the price increase permanent? Is the price increase competitive within the marketplace? Do competitors offer the same or a better product / service at a cheaper price?  </p>
<p>For example  </p>
<p>Has the business lost any customers / contracts as a result of the price increase?</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Usually a price increase would be intended to be permanent however what if the business competitors offer the same product / service at a reduced cost. If the competitors do not increase their price, then the business may be at risk of losing customers and may need to reduce the price to complete. While the current year may show an increase in net profit this may not be sustainable into </span> the future as customers leave. If the business has not lost any customers as a result, this is a  good outcome but what supports the change as sustainable?</li>
<li><span><span>To ensure the business would not lose existing contracts, the business explored what their competitors offered.   As well as increasing prices they added an extra feature to the product / service.  The cost of the extra feature was negligible and factored into the price change.  With the enhanced product / service the business has attracted more customers since making the change.  They are benefiting from both the increased sales and change to profit margin.  </span></span></li>

<h3><strong><span><span><span>2.6 Fast track self-employed assessment </span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>Fast Track assessment is a simple Self-Employed income assessment method relying on the applicants 2 year’s personal Australian Taxation Office (ATO) Notice of Assessments (NOA's). To assess income under the Self-employed Fast Track income verification method, the eligibility criteria must be met. Income from the self-employed applicant is to be verified completely from the applicants personal ATO NOA’s. No further income documentation is to be requested. </span></span><br/>
<span><span>If the applicant is self-employed and also has a second completely independent PAYG job, the PAYG income will also be verified from the ATO NOA’s only. If the PAYG employment commenced after the period covered by the NOAs, and the income is required for serviceability assessment, then Fast Track is <strong>not</strong> available and the </span></span><em><span><span><span>Fully verified self-employed standard assessment – 2 year average</span></span></span></em><span><span>  method must be used. </span></span><br/>
<span><span>The <strong>only</strong> exception where income can be considered that is not captured in the ATO NOA’s held is rental income, where the rental income commenced after the financial years covered by the ATO NOA’s provided. In this instance investment property expenses must be identified and included in-line with Living Expenses policy.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>When the applicant has investment properties that earned rental income during the ATO NOA period (either part of, or the entire period), then it is acceptable to load a $0 investment property expense for this real estate, as the expenses are already captured in the ATO NOA taxable income figure.  In this scenario the following comment, or similar, must be entered as the $0 expense explanation:</span></span><br/>
<em><span><span>“Nil investment property expenses captured as the rental property was owned during the period covered by the ATO NOAs (or part thereof), and the rental expenses are factored into the total taxable income figure sourced from the NOA.”</span></span></em><br/>
			 <br/>
<span><span><strong>Notes</strong>: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>When a property is only rented for part of the period covered by the ATO NOA’s no annualisation of rental income is permitted under Fast Track and there is no expectation to load additional investment property expenses.  If rental income of this nature requires annualisation for the serviceability assessment then Fast Track is <strong>not</strong> available and the <em><span>Fully verified self-employed standard assessment - 2 year average</span></em>  method must be used.</li>
<li>When the ATO NOA shows franking credits, no adjustment of the taxable income is required to account for the franking credit. A franking credit must not be added to or subtracted from the Taxable income figure.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong><span><span><span>Exception authorities do not extend to Fast Track eligibility criteria.</span></span></span></strong><br/>
<br/>
			 </h3>
<h3><strong><span><span><span>2.6.1 Eligibility criteria – Fast track self-employed assessment</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>Applicant has been Self-employed for more than 2 full financial years; and </span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Borrower type – individual, joint applicants, individuals as trustee for a trust, joint applicants as trustee for a trust (note: also refer to </span></span><em><span><span>Eligibility</span></span></em><span><span> policy)</span></span></li>
<li>Income to be assessed from <strong>2 years</strong> ATO Notice of Assessments that meet age of document requirements. It is mandatory to hold all pages of the ATO NOA for Fast Track Self-employed</li>
<li>Any capital gains income on the ATO NOA are excluded and must be deducted for income assessment</li>
<li>Where rental income commenced, after the financial years covered by the ATO NOA’s:
				<ul>
<li><strong><span><span><span>Evidence<sup>#</sup> is required to confirm the property was acquired, or the property was only rented, after the end of the financial year ATO NOA's held.</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> (Evidence of the purchase date of the property may be via a Conveyancers Settlement Statement or for existing customers, a prior <em><span>clas</span></em> application)</span></span></span>; and</li>
<li>Rental income must be assessed in-line with Verifying income policy. Refer <span>Verifying Income &gt;</span> rules you must apply &gt; Supplementary Income; and</li>
<li><span><span><span>The rental income must be loaded against the related property icon in <em><span>clas</span></em> </span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rental income tax deductions for Australian investment properties (Negative Gearing) can only be considered where rental income commenced after the financial years covered by the ATO NOA.

</ul>
<sup><span><span><span>#</span></span></span></sup><span><span><span>If evidence of the purchase date, or commencement date of the rental contract is <strong><span>unable</span></strong> to be supplied, the rental income is to be removed from the application / serviceability calculation e.g. deleted from the <em><span>clas</span></em> property icon. In addition, no tax deduction is allowed against the asset within the <em><span>clas</span></em> affordability tab.</span></span></span><br/>

<span><span>Where the following apply the Fast Track process cannot be used:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>Application has mortgage insurance</li>
<li>Foreign income is received by the applicant</li>
<li>Undistributed company profit is required in addition to the Fast Track income to meet serviceability. <strong>Note: </strong>Dividends (either from own company or other ASX shares) and/or Trust distribution income included in the applicants’ ATO NOAs is acceptable and should not be adjusted in any way.</li>
<li>Rental income has been entered separately in the loan application <strong>and it</strong> has been earned in any year covered by the ATO Notice of Assessment provided</li>
<li>Applicant has been self-employed for less than 2 full financial years</li>
<li><span><span>If either <span>Fully verified self-employed assessment (Latest year income)</span> or <span>Fully verified self-employed assessment - COVID Recovery (FY2019 income)</span> assessment methods are being used.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<span><span>In some cases Credit may decide the application needs to be assessed as a </span></span><em><span><span><span>Fully verified self-employed standard assessment - 2 year average</span></span></span></em><span><span> application, where this occurs the applicant will need to provide additional information. For example, if the application refers to Credit due to 'income &gt; 130% of prior year', Credit will review the application and decide if it can continue to proceed using the fast track process.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>Where applicants are unable to satisfy <strong>all</strong> of the above conditions the applicant must be assessed using </span></span><em><span><span><span>Fully verified self-employed standard assessment - 2 year average</span></span></span></em><span><span> criteria. </span></span>
<h3><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Where there are multiple self-employed applicants and the applicants receive income from the same self-employed business or if any of the self-employed entities are inter linked (between the applicants), then the income must be verified using the same assessment method.  It is however acceptable to verify one applicant under Fast Track and another applicant under </span></span></span><em><span><span><span><span>Fully verified self-employed standard assessment - 2 year average</span></span></span></span></em><u><span><span> <span><span>when their business entities are completely independent of each other and the applicants do not receive income from the same entity. </span></span></span></span></u></h3>
