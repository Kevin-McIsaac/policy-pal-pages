<span><span>In order to meet our Responsible Lending obligations we need to determine that the credit contract will not be unsuitable for the borrower. The unsuitability assessment includes verifying the borrower’s financial situation.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>For St.George Bank Group the financial situation verification includes:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>Income document verification  </li>
<li>Serviceability assessment</li>
<li>Credit bureau enquiry and check</li>
<li>Commitment assessment</li>
<li>Checking for undisclosed Liabilities</li>
</ul>
<span><span><span> An approval in principle <strong>or</strong> formal approval can only be issued after the FSV check has been completed. </span></span></span><br/>
<span><span><span>The below chapters provide additional information to assist with the completion of the FSV check:</span></span></span>

<span><span><a id="2.1.2 FSV expiry" name="2.1.2 FSV expiry"><strong>2.1.2 FSV expiry</strong></a></span></span></h4>
<span><span>The FSV expiry date is linked to the loan purpose, where the purpose is for:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>a combination of purchase where we are also taking the property as security and non-purchase* within a single <em>clas</em> application, the expiry period is 120 days; or</li>
<li>a purchase where we are taking the property as security, the expiry period is 120 days; or</li>
<li>a non-purchase*, the expiry period is 90 days</li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>*A non-purchase includes refinances, limit increases, cashout or any other purpose where we are not financing the purchase of a property that we are also taking as security.</span></span></span><br/>
<span><span>If the </span></span><span><span>FSV is due to expire within 14 days <strong>or</strong> has already expired, a system FSV red traffic light will prevent the Assessor or </span></span><span><span>Credit </span></span><span><span>from:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>running LDS and issuing either an AIP or formal approval; or</li>
<li>printing Loan Offer documents</li>
</ul>
 <br/>
<span><span>To progress the application, all FSV assessment requirements must be re-verified, and FSV task re-completed (to reset the FSV expiry clock) before formal approval can be attempted.  Also refer to</span></span><span><span> <a href="#2.1.1 Overview – FSV">Overview - FSV</a></span></span><span><span> and Changes to financial situation – FSV.</span></span><br/>
<strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: There is no ability to over-ride FSV expiry.</span></span>
<h4> </h4>
<h4><a id="2.1.3 Age of Documents - FSV" name="2.1.3 Age of Documents - FSV"><strong><span><span><span>2.1.3 Age of Documents - FS</span></span></span>V</strong></a></h4>
<span><span>In all cases Age of documents are measured against the most recently completed FSV date.  Also see<span> <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000559">Document standards </a></span>&gt; Minimum documents standards matrix for additional information.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>New supporting documents will be required where: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>FSV has expired; or</li>
<li>FSV will expire in less than 14 days; or</li>
<li>When the AIP was issued the verification document was not available or did not meet policy requirements in terms of minimum information to be supplied; or</li>
<li>The document exceeded maximum age of document policy rules (before FSV has been completed and documents exception has not been approved by an appropriate DRA holder); or</li>
<li>Credit or the Mortgage Insurers have requested updated information to proceed to formal approval.</li>
</ul>

<span><span>Where an application is submitted via a 3<sup><span>rd</span></sup> party lodgement system the FSV task will be a pre-completed task. This allows the assessment system to issue an unverified ‘approval in principle’ for eligible applications.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>Once the application has been received by the bank, the documents submitted in support of the application are to be verified.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>The assessor <strong>may</strong> manually reset the FSV task to ‘pending’ before re-completing the verification tasks and re-completing the FSV task to reset the FSV expiry clock.  If the task is not reset by the assessor, then the original FSV completion date linked to the date the application was submitted via the 3<sup><span>rd</span></sup> party lodgement system will be applied to the application.  Also see </span></span><a href="#2.1.2 FSV expiry"><span><span>FSV expiry</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span><br/>

<h4><strong><span><span><a id="acceptance of loan offer doc" name="acceptance of loan offer doc"></a>2.3.4 Acceptance of loan offer document</span></span></strong></h4>
<span><span>For a loan offer to be valid, customers are required to accept and return the document to the Bank within 14 days of the date of Loan Offer.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>Where the loan offer is signed, dated and noted in system as received by the Bank outside of the <strong>14 days period, but </strong>the FSV 90 or 120 days has not expired<strong>, </strong>the Bank may proceed with the credit contract and notify the borrower of our acceptance.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>Where the loan offer is signed, dated and noted as received by the Bank outside of the 14 day period <strong>and</strong> the 90 or 120 day FSV period has expired we must <strong>reverify the customer’s financial situation:</strong></span></span>
<ul>
<li>The bank can-not enter into the credit contract. If the customer still wishes to proceed, the loan will need to be reset and the loan must be fully re-assessed. If a new formal approval is granted, new Loan Offer Documents will be required. The new loan offer must be printed and provided to the applicant(s).   Credit are unable to authorise the use of an earlier LOD version number. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Note</strong>:</li>
<li>If the loan is Mortgage Insured, the application (including the valuation) may no longer meet requirements. Check before relying on existing records.</li>
<li>FSV task is unable to be marked as ‘pending’ and recompleted without changing the loan status from approved. </li>
</ul>
<span><span>Where the Loan offer has been <strong><span>accepted </span></strong></span>by both the customer and the Bank within the FSV expiry period: </span>
<ul>
<li>The customer has up to 112 days from the formal approval date in which to settle / draw down the loan where the purpose of the loan is for a purchase, refinance, non-structural improvements without progress payments, equity release. After this time applications will expire / withdraw.</li>
</ul>
  

<h4><strong><span><span><a id="loan offer expired" name="loan offer expired"></a>2.3.5 Loan offer expired</span></span></strong></h4>
<span><span>Where &gt; 140 days has passed since Formal approval without the loan settling / drawing down, and where the purpose of the loan is for a purchase, refinance, non-structural improvements without progress payments, equity release, the existing file will withdraw.<br/>
If the customer still wishes to proceed, the loan will need to be reset and the loan must be fully re-assessed.<br/>
If the loan is Mortgage Insured, the valuation may no longer meet requirements. Check before relying on existing records.<br/>
If approval is granted, new Loan Offer Documents will be required.</span></span><br/>
 
<h4><strong><span><span><a id="2.1.6 fre asked qus" name="2.1.6 fre asked qus"></a>2.3.6 Frequently asked questions - </span></span>Assessment period under Responsible Lending</strong></h4>
<strong><span><span>Q1</span></span></strong><span><span>. My customer is purchasing a property and settlement has been delayed. Although the customer accepted the LOD within 90 days, the proposed settlement date is &gt;140 days since the original formal approval.  Credit told me I need to re-assess the application, complete verification requirements again and issue a new LOD. Why?<br/>
<strong><span>A1.</span></strong></span></span><span><span> After 140 days both the customer’s formal approval and loan offer documents have expired. Before we make a new offer to lend, we need to ensure the loan is still suitable for our customer.  We do this by getting new financial information and re-assessing the application.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><span>Q2</span></strong></span></span><span><span>. If the customer is self-employed and the financials are still within age of document requirements, what am I supposed to be checking?<br/>
<strong><span>A2. </span></strong></span></span><span><span>While the age of the financials used for assessing affordability may still be acceptable, we need to confirm that our applicant has not sold the business (Eg the income stream the original assessment was based on is still relevant). <br/>
If your investigations show that the original income stream is no longer available, you would need to see if the customer had other acceptable income which could be used to service the loan.<br/>
In the event the customer has no other acceptable income, then the application would be unable to proceed.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><span>Q4</span></strong></span></span><span><span>. If I have a  formally approved an application, and the customer later changes their mind about which product they want to take, do I have to worry about re-assessing the application and completing the verification requirements again?<br/>
<strong><span>A4.</span></strong></span></span><span><span> Yes, when the change of product is made or you add the advantage package in the loan application, you need to re-complete the verification tasks before a new formal approval and LOD’s are issued to the customer (and including FSV check if it has expired).<br/>
For more information about <strong><span>formal application date</span></strong></span> refer to section 1.1 </span><a href="#8.1.2 Approval in Principal">Approval in Principle </a><span><span>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><span>Q6. </span></strong></span></span><span><span>If the application file has withdrawn, can I have the file and formal approval re-instated and rest on the original LOD’s?<br/>
<strong><span>A6.</span></strong></span> <span>Where the LOD's have been returned but settlement was delayed <strong>and</strong> exceptional mitigating circumstances are identified, the request may be referred to Credit for consideration.  In addition, settlement is required to occur within 5 days of the application being re-instated to prevent the file being withdrawn a second time. </span></span><br/>
<span><span>Where the LOD’s were not returned refer to <a href="#acceptance of loan offer doc">Acceptance</a></span></span><span><span><span><span><a href="#acceptance of loan offer doc"> of loan offer document</a> and <a href="#2.1.2 FSV expiry">FSV expiry</a></span></span></span></span><br/>
