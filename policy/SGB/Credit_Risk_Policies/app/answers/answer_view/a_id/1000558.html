<h2><a id="about" name="about"><strong>1. About this policy</strong></a></h2>
<h3><br/>
<span><span><strong><a id="def" name="def"></a>1.1 Definition of a borrower </strong></span></span></h3>
<span><span>Borrowers (may also be referred to as obligors or debtors) are individual / natural person(s) and non-natural entities that are eligible to access the suite of Residential Lending Products (consumer mortgage products) assessed under Consumer Lending Policies.</span></span><br/>
 
<h3><strong><a id="what" name="what"></a>1.2 What is loan purpose</strong></h3>
<span><span>The loan purpose indicates the reason why a borrower is applying for a loan. The purpose of the loan is used to make a decision on the borrower’s suitability, eligibility, the risk associated with the transaction as well as setting the appropriate pricing for the loan.<br/>
Note: Loan purpose and borrower type also determines whether the <em><u><span><span>National Credit Code</span></span></u></em></span></span><span><span> (NCC) applies. The National Credit Code (NCC) requirements apply in addition to the policy specified in this chapter.</span></span>
<h4><span><span><strong><a id="why" name="why"></a>1.2.1 Why this policy</strong></span></span></h4>
<span><span>  </span></span><br/>
<span><span>The purpose of this policy is to provide an overview of: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>The acceptable borrowers for Consumer Mortgage loans</li>
<li>The acceptable loan purposes for Consumer Mortgage loans</li>
<li>Co-Borrowers eligibility requirements for Consumer Mortgage loans</li>
</ul>
<span><span> <br/>
Loans may be made available to existing customers or non-customers provided they can meet Bank eligibility criteria and the loan is deemed not unsuitable.  Applicants need to demonstrate: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>The legal capacity to enter into a Credit Contract. (Bank policy requires that the minimum age of an applicant has to be 18 years).</li>
<li>A satisfactory financial position for age/income with the ability to meet all existing and proposed commitments in accordance with the Bank's debt servicing criteria without enduring financial hardship.</li>
<li>They are receiving a substantial benefit from the loan transaction</li>
</ul>
<span><span>It is contrary to credit policy to add a borrower to any loan facility to increase servicing/borrowing power. Furthermore, guarantors’ incomes may not be added to borrower's incomes when assessing servicing capacity. </span></span>
<ul>
<li>A satisfactory credit history.</li>
<li>Stability in employment with a regular, predictable and verifiable income source.</li>
<li>Stable residency or mobility through employment (e.g. teacher, police officer etc.)</li>
<li>They are not aware of any significant changes to their financial situation that would adversely impact their ability to meet loan repayments. If a customer indicates that they are aware of adverse changes that may impact their ability to make repayments the loan must be referred to the Credit Team with details of the change, the expected impact, and any mitigating circumstances that Credit should consider when reviewing the application.</li>
</ul>
<span><span> </span></span><span><span> <br/>
You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to: </span></span>

<h2><strong>2. Rules you must apply</strong></h2>
<h3><strong><a id="id" name="id"></a>2.1 Identifying the borrower</strong></h3>
  <br/>
<span><span>All applicants/borrowers must be identified before any loan application is processed. Under no circumstances can an account be opened (including any loan account) without the required identification.<br/>
It is essential when processing loans that the documentation used to confirm identification is recorded.<br/>
You must confirm the applicant’s/borrower's residency status as specific policy rules may apply to your individual applicant. For further information refer <a data-tagid="2.3 Australian Citizen residency status" href="#2.3 Australian Citizen residency status">Australian Citizen residency status</a> and </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000564"><em>Migrant Lending </em></a><span><span>.</span></span>
<h3><br/>
<strong><a id="eligible" name="eligible"></a>2.2 Eligible Borrowers for a Consumer Mortgage Loan</strong></h3>
<div><span><span>The following Borrower types are eligible to receive Consumer Mortgage Loans.<br/>
Eligibility is assessed at the time the Borrower is applying for the loan.<br/>
Borrowers not described in this section are unacceptable to receive consumer lending products. Refer to individual Product Specifications for any additional Product specific restrictions and eligibility criteria.</span></span></div>

<strong><span><span><a id="vul" name="vul"></a>2.4 Customers Experiencing Vulnerability</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>When interviewing a customer or processing a consumer mortgage loan application, you must take extra care if:</span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>you notice a vulnerability, or</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>a vulnerability is disclosed to you.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span>Customer vulnerability referes to customers in circumstances which make them more susceptible to harm, loss or disadvantage (wither personal or financial) then a person not in those circumstances. This means that they may require extra care to help them achieve a similar service outcome to someone who is not in vulnerable circumstances.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>Vulnerable customers include those experiencing:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>Age-related impairment</li>
<li>Cognitive impairment</li>
<li>Elder abuse</li>
<li>Family or domestic violence</li>
<li>Financial abuse</li>
<li>Mental illness or mental health problems</li>
<li>Serious illness and severe or long-term illness</li>
<li>Gambling</li>
<li>Scams</li>
<li>Any other personal or financial circumstances causing significant detriment.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<ins datetime="2020-09-15T16:03"><span><span><span>There are many types of vulnerability and learning a catalogue of circumstances may not always be helpful. Be alert to recognise the potential signs of someone experiencing vulnerable circumstances and use the extra care mindset:</span></span></span></ins>
<ul>
<li><ins datetime="2020-09-15T16:03"><span>Act with Sensitivity</span></ins></li>
<li><ins datetime="2020-09-15T16:03"><span>Act with Compassion</span></ins></li>
<li><ins datetime="2020-09-15T16:03"><span>Act with Respect</span></ins></li>
</ul>
<div><ins datetime="2020-09-15T16:03"><span>It is with that extra care mindset, that Lenders and Brokers are to ensure all borrowers and guarantors fully understand the commitment they are entering into. </span></ins></div>

<br/>
<a id="bcop" name="bcop"></a>2.5.1 Banking Code of Practice (BCoP)</strong></h3>
<div> <span><span>In compliance with the Banking Code of Practice (BCoP), we will not approve an individual as a co-borrower on a loan unless they will receive a </span></span><a href="#substantial"><em> </em><em>substantial benefit </em> </a><span><span>from that loan. <br/>
 <br/>
A loan should not be structured as a co-borrower loan where the customer is better suited to be a guarantor simply to enable processing.<br/>
 <br/>
Where it appears that a co-borrower is experiencing financial abuse, the application must not be submitted for assessment as a co-borrower loan. Refer to <a href="#vul">Customers Experiencing Vulnerability</a> for scenarios which may indicate a customer may be vulnerable.</span></span><br/>
 </div>
<br/>
<strong><a id="substantial" name="substantial"></a>2.5.2 Substantial benefit test</strong><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>A substantial benefit requires that each co-borrower must get a real and tangible benefit arising out of the underlying transaction. That is, where there are 2 or more co-borrowers: </span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span><span>Property Purchase</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span>Each co-borrower has a direct legal or equitable ownership interest of at least 30%<sup>*</sup> in the asset (i.e. property) being purchased with the loan funds</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>Refinance</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span>At least 30%<sup>*</sup> of the loan funds will be used to repay or refinance debts or other obligations in each co-borrower’s name.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>Equity Release / Cash out</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>At least 30%<sup>*</sup> of the released equity / cash out loan funds will be used for the direct benefit of each of the co-borrowers.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>Where loan funds will be used for multiple purposes, each of the co-borrowers must receive a substantial benefit of the total loan amount.</span></span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span><sup>* </sup>If there are more than two co-borrowers, or the co-borrowers have different levels of ownership, then the percentage figure may be reasonably adjusted. For example, 4 co-borrowers could be 25% each. If the minimum percentage is not met, consider whether the applicant who is not receiving a substantial benefit from the loan is better protected under a guarantor structure.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Brokers must enquire of the borrowers how the loan funds will be used and ensure the percentage of loan funds used meets the policy minimum.<br/>
Brokers must also record in the loan origination system, details of the customer’s response and the reasons why both borrowers will receive a substantial benefit.<br/>
 </strong><br/>
The substantial benefit requirement is to be satisfied on the information the customer has provided us in the course of the loan application. However, further clarification must be sought from the customer if the </span></span>information they provide <span><span>conflicts with any other information disclosed in the application.<br/>
To understand how the substantial benefit requirement applies to individual scenarios (loan origination, refinance or further lending / increase) refer to the below tables: </span></span>
