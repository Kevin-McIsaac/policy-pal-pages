<span><span>This policy will help you determine which real estate and non-real estate security collateral we consider acceptable for consumer mortgages.<br />
<br />
<span>To determine the maximum loan to value ratio (LVR) and valuation requirement for each type of security collateral, refer to the</span>&nbsp;<em><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000685">Loan to Value Ratio (LVR)</a> policy</span></em></span><span> and </span><em><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000687">Security Collateral Value</a> policy</span></em></span><span>. </span><br />
<br />
<span><span>If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000726"><em>Lenders Mortgage Insurance</em></a></span>,&nbsp;where required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; </span>

<h3><a name="A_What_is_residential_real_estate_securi"></a><strong><span><span><span>1.2 What is residential real estate security collateral?</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>The Bank's consumer mortgage lending policy is primarily directed towards standard residential real estate, but non-standard developments may also be acceptable.<br />
<br />
The below table details the&nbsp;policy rules&nbsp;for acceptable real estate security collateral.<br />

<h4><a name="R_ACT_"></a><strong><span><span><span>2.11.3 ACT asbestos affected homes ("Mr Fluffy")&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></h4>
<span><span>Individual owners have been written to by the ACT Government outlining a government buy back offer.<br />
<br />
This is due to ongoing public health and safety risks posed by the continuing presence of loose fill asbestos insulation in Canberra homes. Participation in the Buyback Program is voluntary and eligible home owners must lodge an application directly with the ACT Government taskforce by <strong><span>Tuesday, 30 June 2015</span></strong></span></span><span><span>.<br />
<br />
If the owners take up the ACT Government offer, the intent is to demolish dwellings and remove the contamination then return the previously affected blocks back to the market for resale, with former owners (shown as at Tuesday, 28 October 2014 as the offer is not transferable), having a first right of refusal to purchase the affected block (at full market value, to be determined at the time of purchase) after it is remediated. Owners will be compensated by way of the ACT Government engaging two API accredited valuers to determine a market value of the property as if it were not affected by the loose fill asbestos, in order to establish the amount to be paid as 'buy back'.<br />
<br />
(Refer ACT Government web site for further background information. </span></span><a href="http://www.act.gov.au/asbestos-response-taskforce"><em><span><span>http://www.act.gov.au/asbestos-response-taskforce</span></span></em></a><span><span> .)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For the security to be acceptable the following conditions must be met: </span></span>

<ul>
	<li>There is no current market for the sale and purchase of affected homes and therefore affected properties have a nil lending value until the ACT Government offer is made and accepted by the owners (as shown as at 28/10/14).</li>
	<li>Only the ACT Government agreed security value is to be used as the security assessment. No other security assessment is to be relied on.</li>
	<li>A copy of the ACT Government offer must be held as the security assessment.</li>
	<li>Proof the ACT Government offer has been accepted by the customer must be held prior to full approval.</li>
	<li>All Government conditions must be met, e.g. customer can only be the registered owner as at 28/10/2014 as the offer is not transferable.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="R_NSW_"></a><strong><span><span><span>2.11.4 NSW asbestos affected homes ("Mr Fluffy")&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></h4>
<span><span>In NSW, owners have two options:<br />
<br />
a) Under <strong><span>Option 1</span></strong></span></span><span><span>, homeowners will be offered the value of the whole property (land and improvements).<br />
<br />
b) Under <strong><span>Option 2</span></strong></span></span><span><span>, homeowners will be offered the value of the whole property minus the value of the land. For rural properties, homeowners will be offered the value of the affected premises and any building or structures on its curtilage. The curtilage is the area, usually enclosed, that encompasses the grounds and buildings immediately surrounding the premises that are used in daily domestic activities. The effect of this process is that homeowners are offered the value of the affected premises by itself.<br />
<br />
Refer NSW Government web page for further information. </span></span><a href="http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Loose_fill_asbestos_insulation/Voluntary_purchase_and_demolition_program/Demolition_and_remediation_process.page"><em><span><span>http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Loose_fill_asbestos_insulation/Voluntary_purchase_and_demolition_program/Demolition_and_remediation_process.page</span></span></em></a><span><span> .<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>a) If the customer accepts option 1.</span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span>Sale and discharge proceeds as normal.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>b) If the customer accepts option 2.</span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span>1. Customer is required as part of the scheme to provide 'written confirmation from any financial institution that holds an interest over the property that acknowledges my/our intent to proceed with Option 2.' to the scheme i.e. Customer will contact the Bank to advise they have accepted option 2.<br />
2. Security Variation Unit (SVU) - will receive customer notification and will acknowledge receipt to the customer.<br />
3. Customer will then provide signed License Agreement to the Bank<br />
4. When the funds from the scheme are received, the loan balance and limit will be reduced to a maximum of 80% of land value in the original NSW Government offer (i.e. NSW Government agreed security value for the land).<br />
5. For re-construction of the property, a new construction loan will be required once customer has identified a builder. All normal lending criteria applies and the new Progress Draw loan will be processed as normal.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Other information</span></strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span>For the security to be acceptable the following conditions must be met: </span></span>

<ul>
	<li>There is no current market for the sale and purchase of affected homes and therefore affected house / unit properties have a nil lending value until the building is demolished and removed.</li>
	<li>Only the NSW Government agreed security value for the land is to be used as the security assessment. No other security assessment is to be relied on. The only exception to the acceptance of the land value is where customers wishes to purchase another property prior to receiving the purchase proceeds from the NSW Government and needs to fund all or part of the purchase price of the new property via a bridging loan from the Bank. The bridging loan should be processed with the following criteria:</li>
	<li>Customer must show evidence that they have accepted the NSW Government offer option 2 (sale of house and land) via signed License Agreement.</li>
	<li>The security value of the asbestos affected property is the value listed in the NSW Government offer.</li>
	<li>A copy of the NSW Government offer must be held as the security assessment.</li>

<span><span>&nbsp;<br />
Homes for Homes (H4H) is a social housing initiative established by The Big Issue that will generate funds by encouraging developers and home owners to pledge a small percentage of the sale proceeds of their home (approx. 0.1%).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Standard policy rules apply for H4H properties. Refer to </span></span><a href="#P_Home_for_Homes_(H4H)"><em><span><span>Homes for Homes (H4H)</span></span></em></a><span><span> process for specific processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3><a name="P_Home_for_Homes_(H4H)"></a><span><strong><span>3.1 Home for Homes (H4H)</span></strong></span></h3>
<span><span>&nbsp;<br />
Participation in the H4H scheme is voluntary for our customers and they can opt-out at any time. The scheme has been rolled out to all states in Australia. To facilitate this process, the owners execute a Deed of Donation with Homes for Homes who lodge a permissive caveat on the title. To register a Transfer of Ownership or Mortgage, consent from Homes for Homes will be required to be provided to the LTO with our settlement documents for lodgement.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The type of consent required by the LTO to accept the lodgement of our documents is specific to each state. To assist team members with understanding what information is required at settlement, a state based requirements matrix has been created.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Where our customer does not wish to donate, they can request the Withdrawal of Caveat from the charity, which will need to be provided at settlement if the customer would like the bank to lodge it as part of our lodgement documents.<br />

			</ul>
			<span><span><span><b>Old policy wording for ‘Second Mortgage behind other financial institution’:</b></span></span></span><br />
			<span><span><span>The Westpac Group prefers to be the only mortgagee on a security property.&nbsp; There may be some instances where we take a second mortgage, for example, where the second mortgage is covering a shortfall in security by the primary property (e.g. Family Security Guarantee loan option).</span></span></span><br />
			<br />
			<span><span><span>A second mortgage may be taken to cover a shortfall of security including a guarantee where the Primary security is being taken by / or is already held with Westpac Bank Group registered as the 1st mortgagee.</span></span></span><br />
			<span><span><span>The below scenarios are excluded:</span></span></span><br />
			<span><span><span>If the existing 1st mortgage is for a reverse mortgage styled facility</span></span></span><br />
			<span><span><span>The 1st mortgagee is not a Financial institution, i.e. is a private mortgage provider. Private mortgage providers include but are not limited to an individual, a solicitor, vendor finance.</span></span></span><br />
			<span><span><span>LMI applies to the proposed loan and the first mortgage is not held by Westpac Group</span></span></span><br />
			<span><span><span>Note :</span></span></span><br />
			<span><span><span>For St.George Bank Group: Westpac and RAMS are considered to be external providers / other financial institutions.</span></span></span><br />
			<span><span><span>Brokers&nbsp;should advise the applicant(s) that second mortgage scenarios may lead to longer settlement time frames that are outside of Westpac Bank Group's control.&nbsp; Delays can occur when we write to the prior mortgagee seeking consent to register the second mortgage and we ask the prior mortgagee to establish their priority amount.</span></span></span><br />
			<span><span><span>For more information refer to Loan to Value Ratio (LVR)</span></span></span><br />

			<span><span><span><strong><span>Change 2</span></strong></span></span></span><br />
			<strong><span><span><span>For “Checking the Security Development Register (SDR) for a listing” when the unit must be included on the SDR, have added “(no exceptions including credit)”</span></span></span></strong></td>

To assist team members with understanding what information is required at settlement, a state based requirements matrix has been created.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nWhere our customer does not wish to donate, they can request the Withdrawal of Caveat from the charity, which will need to be provided at settlement if the customer would like the bank to lodge it as part of our lodgement documents.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<strong><span>Homes for Homes matrix<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp; <\/span>\n\n<table align=\"left\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"102%\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<h4><strong><span><span><span>State&nbsp; <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<h4><strong><span><span><span>Prevents<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<h4><strong><span><span><span>Letter of Consent requirements<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<h4><strong><span><span><span>Withdrawal of Caveat for paper settlement and standalone electronic lodgement process<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<h4><strong><span><span><span>PEXA lodgement, settlement process, and where caveat is to remain<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><span><span>WA<\/span><\/span><\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Caveat\/Charge does not prevent the lodgement of any instruments as instructed by the Charity Homes for Homes<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>Letter of Consent is not required in WA as the Caveat does not prevent the lodgement of any instruments.
