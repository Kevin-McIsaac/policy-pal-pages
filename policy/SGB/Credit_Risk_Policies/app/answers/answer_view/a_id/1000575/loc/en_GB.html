 <span><span>This policy identifies the acceptable sources of income and methods used to verify these incomes for residential lending purposes including new loan origination, loan increases, any servicing or variation activity requiring a serviceability assessment. </span></span><br/>
 <br/>
<span><strong><span>If the income type is not listed, then the income type is not acceptable</span></strong></span><span>. Income types not listed may only be considered by </span><em><span><span>Credit</span></span></em><span> where:</span>
<ul>
<li>appropriate mitigants have been provided and;</li>
<li>evidence of the income can be obtained to complete verificationAll income and employment verification is to be completed prior to approval.<br/>
	 <br/>
	The following applies when verifying income and employment documentation provided by applicant:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all applicants/guarantors have signed the Privacy Statement (refer to  Home Loan application form policy)</li>
<li>Ensure documents furnished by applicant/s conform to policy requirements. Ascertain whether verbal verification is required.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to:
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000559">Document Standards</a></em></li>

<li><em><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000556">Self-employed applicants</a></em></li>
</ul>

<strong>Note:</strong> If result of step 3 is greater than the closing Member Balance and no other income source is applicable, it appears the income will not be sustainable for the life of the loan.  Discuss other options with Applicant, for example, a reduced loan term.  If serviceability is not able to be demonstrated over a shorter loan term or if there are other mitigating factors, the application may be referred to Credit for consideration.</li>

<span><span>The narrative on the payslip shows ‘voluntary superannuation contribution’ or non-Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contribution, why do I still need to get the customer to complete the salary sacrifice declaration form?</span></span></td>
<td><br/>
<span><span>The salary sacrifice declaration form helps us have a conversation with our customer and record the outcome of those discussions.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>In some cases the applicant may be unwilling or unable to cancel the deductions, therefore it is important that we do not make an assumption that the amount of the deduction is going to be available to meet this new loan commitment.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>For example:</span></span>
<ol>
<li>The voluntary salary sacrifice deduction on the payslip is being used by the applicant towards a Self- Managed Superannuation Fund Home Loan.</li>
</ol>
<span><span>Because of the shortfall between rent received on the investment property and the SMSF Home loan repayment, the applicant is unable to cancel the deduction.</span></span>
<ol>
<li value="2">The applicant’s employer pays an additional superannuation contribution above SGC where the employee makes a voluntary contribution.</li>
</ol>
<span><span>If the employee cancels the voluntary contribution, then they will lose the benefit of the above SGC employer contribution. The applicant is unwilling to cancel the deduction as they will suffer a long term financial impact.</span></span>
<ol>
<li value="3">The applicant has previously had a marital financial settlement.  They are making voluntary contributions so they can rebuild their superannuation.  As they are planning for their retirement, they are unwilling to cancel the voluntary contribution amount.</li>
</ol>
</td>

<tr>
<td><br/>
<span><span>When don’t I need to get the salary sacrifice declaration form?</span></span></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>If the amount of the salary sacrifice deduction is not required for serviceability assessment, then you do not need a salary sacrifice declaration form. Your loan serviceability assessment will be based on the lower income figure.</li>
<li>The deduction is an after tax deduction.  While you may need to include the deduction as a commitment or living expense, it is not reducing the customer’s taxable income and no salary sacrifice declaration form is required.</li>
</ul>
</td>

<tr>
<td><span><span>Why would my customer not be able to cancel a deduction for purchased leave?</span></span></td>
<td><br/>
<span><span>The applicant may need to contact their employer to check under what basis they are able to cancel the deduction.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>For instance if the applicant has already taken the leave, repayment amount may be spread over the remaining year and might be unable to cancel the deduction.</span></span></td>

<span><span>Why can’t my customer cancel their novated lease deduction?</span></span></td>

<span><span>Early cancellation of the novated lease may result in negative tax implications for the customer.</span></span><br/>

<span><span>Do I need to verify the employment type just from what the customer tells me, or do I need to validate it from the payslip or some other source?</span></span></td>
<td><br/>
<span><span>Employment type must be customer declared and we don't require any verification or other validation.  This is because the information is not always available on the payslips or other documents. <br/>
			If there is an occupation or employment status evident on the payslip which contradicts what the customer states, further clarification is required in line with </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000574"> Validation of information provided by the customer</a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000364"> </a><span><span> policy.</span></span></td>

<td><br/>
<span><span>The policy is specific to active duty or frontline Fire Officers, Policy Officers, Paramedics.  It is not available to all employees who work for an emergency services provider.  For example a Fire Officer would need to be based at a Fire Station and not in a call centre or administrative only role.</span></span></td>

<span><span>As we are obtaining a Group 2 document from the previous financial year in addition to the payslips, does this mean the applicant must be continually employed by the same employer for over 12 months?</span></span></td>
<td><br/>
<span><span>Yes.  We need to have both the payslip and the Group 2 documents showing the same employer, as this contributes to demonstrating a history of receiving the non-base income. <br/>
			If the applicant has not been with the same employer across both income verification sources, you may refer the application to Credit for consideration where the applicant has worked in the same job role but with different employers.</span></span></td>

<td><br/>
<span><span>What if a hospital based nurse works across multiple hospitals?</span></span></td>

<span><span>A nurse's employment may require them to work across multiple hospitals, while still being employed with the same organisation.  They may have different payslips which show different locations.  As long as they are ultimately employed by the same employer this is acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
			Applicants would also qualify if they are permanently employed by more than one employer.  For example, if a nurse works permanent part time 2 days a week at a public hospital and 3 days a week at a private hospital.  You would need payslips and group 2 documents for each employer to be able to use this policy.</span></span></td>
