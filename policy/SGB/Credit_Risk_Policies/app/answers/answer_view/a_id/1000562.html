<h3><a id="why" name="why"><strong>1.1. Why this policy</strong></a></h3>
<span><span>As a responsible lender, we need to consider how our applicants’ request for a new residential mortgage will impact their financial position.<br/>
The Bank’s debt servicing criteria looks at the applicant(s) ability to meet all existing and proposed regular commitments (debts) and living expenses without enduring financial hardship.<br/>
This policy will help you to understand the assessment of the applicant(s) capacity to service loan in a residential mortgage application.  The following topics are covered in this section: </span></span>
<ul>
<li><a href="#ser"><em>Serviceability assessment </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#jointborrowereg"><em>Joint borrower applications </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#common"><em>Common Debt Reducer (CDR) </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#commitment"><em>Commitment Cover Ratio (CCR) </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#bench"><em>Benchmark, Buffer and Floor rates </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#bench"><em>Product Benchmark rates </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#loan"><em>Loan instalment calculation </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#total com"><em>Total commitments </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#notional rent"><em>Notional Rent </em></a></li>
<li><a href="#hem"><em>Household Expenditure Measure (HEM) </em></a></li>

<h4><strong><span><span>General information</span></span></strong></h4>
<br/>
<span><span>The applicants’ ability to service all debts is to be assessed on a Principal and Interest (P&amp;I) basis, taking account of the requirements for applying a benchmark rate.<br/>
This requirement is irrespective of loan purpose, interest only repayment period, LVR or security to be provided.<br/>
Serviceability assessment is to be completed on a P&amp;I basis over the loan term requested by the applicants, for new loans up to a maximum of 30 years, as follows: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Residential housing or residential investment loans, including multi-sequence loans;</li>
<li>Relocation loans with end debt</li>
</ul>
<span><span>Serviceability assessment is not required for Relocation loans with no end debt. <br/>
<br/>
Where a liability is being repaid in full by this loan application, the loan repayment (monthly / fortnightly etc.) is not included in serviceability calculations. </span></span>
<h4><br/>
<br/>
<span><span><strong>Interest only / combination loans</strong></span></span></h4>
<br/>
<span><span>For Interest Only / Combination loans (i.e. interest only repayment period followed by P&amp;I); serviceability assessment will be calculated over the residual loan amortising term (i.e. the P&amp;I term), and not the total loan term (for both Owner Occupied and Investment loans) - refer to </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000199"><em> </em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000563"><em>Assessing Maximum Loan Term </em></a><span><span>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><span>Example: </span></strong></span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>Overall loan term of 30 years, I/O repayments for 10 years and the residual loan term of 20 years on P&amp;I.  At loan origination, the loan commitment, serviceability assessment is calculated on a P&amp;I basis over the amortising period i.e. 20 years in this case.<br/>
Whilst the minimum term for the interest only/combination loan is 1 year interest only converting to 1 year principal and interest, it is suggested that the P&amp;I term should be set-up for the longest term possible.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><span>Example: </span></strong></span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>On a $200,000 loan the P&amp;I repayments for 1 year @ 6.57% are $17,271 per month and for 25 years $1,365 per month. </span></span>
<h4><br/>
<span><span><strong>Linked loan applications</strong></span></span></h4>
<span><span>Where two or more ApplyOnline applications are proceeding at the same time, brokers are to ensure loan products and repayment types are loaded consistently across all the related / linked loan applications.  For example, where one application contains an interest only loan product, the second or additional application(s) must also show any IO loan repayments being calculated on a P&amp;I basis over the amortising period after the expiry of the I/O term.</span></span>
<h4><br/>
<span><span><strong>Loan variation serviceability requirements</strong></span></span></h4>
<span><span>Where a serviceability assessment is made as part of the loan variation activities, serviceability will be assessed on P&amp;I repayment basis and calculated over the residual loan amortising term (i.e. the P&amp;I term).<br/>
<br/>
A serviceability assessment is to be completed as part of the following loan variation activities: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Loan increases</li>
<li>Extension of interest only period</li>
<li>Switch from Principal and Interest (P&amp;I) repayment type to Interest Only (IO) repayments</li>
<li>Requests to remove name from a fixed rate loan</li>
<li>Extension of loan term</li>
</ul>
<span> (Switches from Portfolio to LIS are not permitted. Where a request is received, applications are to follow the standard new loan origination process </span><span><span>.)</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>Before proceeding with a serviceability assessment for a loan variation activity, you should ensure that the application is within permitted LVR’s or product restrictions.</span></span>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong><a id="co" name="co"></a>2.2 Co-borrower applications</strong></h3>
<span><span>It is contrary to Credit Policy to add a borrower to any loan facility to increase servicing/borrowing power.<br/>
Furthermore, guarantor’s incomes may not be added to applicants' incomes when assessing servicing capacity (in some cases a guarantor may be a </span></span><a href="#common"><em> common debt reducer </em></a><span><span>).<br/>
An acceptable co-borrower application is where a benefit can be demonstrated for all parties who are entering into the loan transaction. Refer to </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000223"> </a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000558#co-bo">Eligiblity </a><span><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000558#co-bo"> policy &gt;2.5 Co-borrower eligibility requirements</a> for further information. <br/>
<br/>
Co-borrowing structures are not permitted where one or more of the applicants are living overseas.  No financial benefit can be demonstrated where the sole or primary income earner will continue to reside overseas post settlement, but have no ownership of the security property.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><span><a id="jointborrowereg" name="jointborrowereg"></a>Example:</span></strong></span><br/>
<br/>
Applicant A is a holder of a temporary visa, they are currently living and working overseas (primary income earner).  The visa type is on the approved list as per </span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000230"><em> </em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000564"><em>Migrant Lending </em></a><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>Applicant B is a holder of a temporary visa, they are currently living in Australia and are not working.  The visa type is on the approved list as per </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000230"><em> </em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000564"><em>Migrant Lending </em></a><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>The application submitted to the bank is to buy an established property for owner occupation in Australia.  The loan is requested in joint names, but the offered security will be in applicant B’s name only.<br/>
<br/>
Post settlement, Applicant A will remain living and working overseas and will not reside in the Australian property.  Applicant B will live in the Australian property but will still not be in paid employment.<br/>
This loan structure is unacceptable for lending.  Applicant A receives no benefit from the transaction, they are not occupying the property post settlement.<br/>
  </span></span><br/>
 
<h3><span><span><strong><a id="common" name="common"></a>2.3 Common Debt Reducer (CDR)</strong></span></span></h3>
<span><span>A CDR is a person who is not an applicant on the proposed loan but shares common debts and/or commitments (which may include living expenses) with one or more of the borrowers.  Typically this is for a husband and wife structure where only one of the parties is an applicant.<br/>
<br/>
An individual receiving foreign income is not acceptable to be used as a CDR.<br/>
<br/>
A CDR scenario should only be used when the applicant cannot support the proposed loan and the total commitment of the shared liabilities on their own.<br/>
<br/>
A servicing assessment must be performed for the CDR, in addition to the normal assessment for the applicant.  All income for the CDR is to be assessed and documented (but not verified) in accordance with existing standard lending policy.  This will mean that the applicant will have to supply the CDR’s income details to be used, otherwise they cannot be assessed.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span></span><br/>
<span><span>It is the broker’s responsibility to remind the applicant what information of the CDR’s they are giving to the Bank and why it is being given.  The broker should also remind the applicant that the applicant acknowledges this when they sign the Privacy Statement.<br/>
<br/>
The CDR’s individual commitment cover ratio (CCR) needs to meet the minimum CCR requirement applied to the product being sought by the borrower, as per policy.  The proposed loan is not included in calculating the serviceability ratio for the CDR (since they are not an applicant), but any other liabilities held by the CDR will need to be included in calculating their servicing capacity, in addition to the existing commitments and expenses shared with the borrower.<br/>
  </span></span><br/>
 
<h3><span><span><strong><a id="commitment" name="commitment"></a>2.4 Commitment Cover Ratio (CCR)</strong></span></span></h3>
<span><span>The applicant(s) capacity to service all debt is rated using the Commitment Cover Ratio measurement (CCR).  The CCR is calculated by dividing all ongoing repayment commitments on the applicants’ total current and proposed debt(s) into the applicants’ income after deducting tax and living expenses.  The result is quoted as 'times’ coverage'.<br/>
<br/>
Minimum CCRs will vary depending on the product, security or borrower type and may be altered from time to time.  <br/>

<span><span>  Benchmark rate  </span></span></td>
<td><span><span>A benchmark rate is an interest rate used by the Bank, to assess a customer’s ability to repay over the term of the loan.  This rate is higher than the actual product interest rate.  There are different benchmark interest rates for each home loan product.<br/>
			The product benchmark rate is determined by adding a buffer rate to the respective St.George, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA standard variable rate (inclusive of the packaged discount or interest rate adjustment).<br/>
			If the St.George, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA standard variable rate (inclusive of packaged discount or interest rate adjustment) plus buffer, is less than the minimum floor rate, then the greater of the two rates will become the benchmark rate and will be automatically applied for serviceability calculation.<br/>
			 <br/>
<strong>Example</strong> of benchmark rate calculation:<br/>
			If the St.George standard owner occupier variable P&amp;I home loan rate is 5.22% p.a. with package discount 1.32% p.a., Bank SA 5.21% p.a. with package discount 1.31% p.a. and BoM is 5.20% p.a. with package discount 1.30% p.a., the benchmark rate will be calculated by adding the buffer rate to the respective brands home loan rate (inclusive of the packaged discount)<br/>
			If the buffer rate is 3.0% p.a. then the benchmark rate for standard owner occupier variable for the respective brands will be: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>St George: (5.22% minus 1.32%) plus 3.0% = 6.90% p.a.</li>
<li>Bank SA: (5.21% minus 1.31%) plus 3.0% = 6.90% p.a.</li>
<li>Bank of Melbourne: (5.20% minus 1.30%) plus 3.0% = 6.90% p.a.</li>
</ul>
<span><span>Since the current floor rate is 5.05% p.a. which is lower than the calculated benchmark rates, the greater of the two rates (i.e. St. George 6.90% p.a., Bank SA 6.90% p.a. and Bank of Melbourne 6.90% p.a.) will become the benchmark rate and will be automatically applied for serviceability calculation.</span></span></td>

<tr>
<td><span><span>Buffer rate</span></span></td>
<td><span><span>The buffer rate is determined by the Bank, it reflects the potential for interest rate increases and seeks to ensure that potential increases in home loan interest rates do not adversely impact on a borrower’s capacity to repay a loan.<br/>
<br/>
			The Bank considers multiple economic factors and the figure is reviewed quarterly.<br/>
<br/>
			Effective 29 October 2021 the buffer rate is 3.0%.</span></span></td>

<td><span><span>Floor rate</span></span></td>

<br/>
			Effective 9 October 2020 the floor rate is 5.05% p.a.</span></span></td>

<strong><span><span>2.14 Rental income tax deductions for Australian investment properties (Negative Gearing)</span></span></strong></h3>
<p><span><span><span><span>Generically, negative gearing occurs when an investment rental property is purchased with the assistance of borrowed funds and the net rental income, after deducting other expenses, is less than the interest on the borrowings.  The overall taxation result of a negatively geared property is that a net rental loss arises.  In these cases, an individual may be able to claim a deduction for the full amount of investment expenses against their rental and other income such as salary, wages or business income, when the tax return for the relevant income year is completed.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span><span> <span><span><strong><a name="R_rental_income_tax_deductions_-_service"></a><span><span>Serviceability</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>For Bank serviceability calculations, we do not determine the full negative gearing benefit an individual may receive in their Australian tax return, instead we calculate an interest deduction related to the investment home loan balance.</span></span></span></span><br/>
The tax deduction amount will be calculated on the actual product interest rate for both internal and external mortgage liabilities.<br/>
<span>The below table identifies the percentage of tax deduction for Bank serviceability purposes which an applicant may claim based on their share of property ownership: </span></p>

<td> <br/>
<span><span>Margin loans repayment and closure have a level of complexity in excess of a standard loan facility. The client may need to close out of the share positions held.  Formal notification by the facility holder may be required prior to repayment commencing. Based on the extra complexities only Credit may consider full refinance requests. Partial debt reduction requests for consumer mortgage products are not available at this time.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span> A novated lease is a financial obligation rather than a loan – as a result, the payout of the novated lease so that the customer may obtain ownership of the asset relies on the lease provider agreeing to sell the asset to the customer. Specific processes need to be followed to complete these processes including requiring the customer to contact the provider to initiate the termination of the lease, approving the ownership transfer, invoicing the customer. Based on the extra complexities the Bank has chosen not to include these facilities in the debt cancellation process for consumer mortgage products at this time.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>Refinance of Tax Debt - </span></span><span> Only Credit may consider applications where the debt is to be refinanced in full (non-MI only). </span><span><span> Partial debt reduction requests are not available for consumer mortgage products at this time. </span></span><span><span>It is recommended that you discuss your scenario with Credit prior to submitting an application as additional information or supporting documents may need to be supplied for the application to be considered.</span></span></td>

			Where a serviceability assessment is made as part of the loan variation activities, serviceability will be assessed on P&amp;I repayment basis and calculated over the residual loan amortising term (i.e. the P&amp;I term).<br/>
<br/>
			A serviceability assessment is to be completed as part of the following loan variation activities:
			<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Loan increases </span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Extension of interest only period </span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Switch from Principal and Interest (P&amp;I) repayment type to Interest Only (IO) repayments </span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Requests to remove name from a fixed rate loan</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Extension of loan term</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span> (Switches from Portfolio to LIS are not permitted. Where a request is received, applications are to follow the standard new loan origination process </span><span><span>.)</span></span><br/>
			 <br/>
			Before proceeding with a serviceability assessment for a loan variation activity, you should ensure that the application is within permitted LVR's <b>or</b> product restrictions.<br/>

<h3><strong><span><span><span>2.15 Debt to Income (DTI) Ratio</span></span></span></strong></h3>
			 <br/>
<span><span><span>Debt To Income Ratio is a loan assessment measure which assists the Westpac Group to apply responsible lending practices in assessing a customer's ability to service existing and proposed debts.</span></span></span><br/>
			 
			<h4><strong><span><span><span><span>2.15.1 DTI definition and calculation</span></span></span></span></strong></h4>
			 <br/>
<span><span><span>DTI = total debt / total gross annual income</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Total debts based on the higher of limit or balance of all liabilities (but ignoring Hire purchase, Leasing, Company / Partnership / Trust liabilities, Business Loans not belonging to a sole trader, any 'Other - Outgoing' liabilities)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Total Gross unshaded annual income (including gross rental income)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<em><span><span><span>Clas</span></span></span></em><span><span><span> will automatically calculate a DTI ratio and refer applications to Credit where the DTI is greater than or equal to seven (7) times.<br/>
<br/>
			Example of DTI calculation</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>A customer has total debts = $500,000 and Total Gross unshaded annual income (including gross rental income) of $65,000</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>DTI calculation is $500,000 / $65,000. DTI ratio = 7.69x</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In this example the message 'Debt to Gross Income Ratio greater than or equal to 7x-CBC'  will be triggered and the loan application would need to be referred to Credit for consideration.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<span><span><span>When the credit referral rule, 'Debt to Gross Income Ratio greater than or equal to 7x-CBC', is returned, Brokers should provide appropriate notes and comments in their submission to Credit to the effect that:</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>They have discussed the level of debt to income with the applicant(s) noting the debt level appears relatively high</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>They have identified any specific circumstances that are contributing to the high DTI result, such as a relocation interest capitalising loan  or other income not able to be included in the DTI calculation</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Where any other policy rules have been triggered in addition to DTI, that valid and strong mitigants can be demonstrated</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>They have completed all required checks per policy and procedures and are satisfied that the customer(s) has the ability to meet repayments on the proposed loan noting the high DTI ratio</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>They have documented any other relevant rationale to support why the deal should still be approved</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
			 <br/>
<span><span><span>Credit will take the following into consideration when considering applications referred for high DTI:</span></span></span>

<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>That the Broker has held detailed conversations with the customer regarding their DTI position, and ability to afford the proposed loan despite the high DTI, and documented this in Notes/Comments accordingly</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Any other policy exceptions or rules triggered</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The LVR, level of monthly surplus, credit history (including anything adverse on their credit bureau) and level of applicant income</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Any specific drivers of high DTI such as Relocation loans or other income not able to be included in the DTI calculation</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Any other supporting comments provided by the lender as to the reason for the high DTI and/or rationale as to why the deal should still be approved despite the high DTI</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
