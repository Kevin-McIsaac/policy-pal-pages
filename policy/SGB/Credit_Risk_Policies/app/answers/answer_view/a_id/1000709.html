			Where the applicant earns PAYG income (or other supplementary income) but also has a  <span><span> directorship </span></span><sup><span><span> 1 </span></span></sup>  or ABN for a business, and the applicant is not being assessed under Fast Track, Lenders / Assessors are required to identify how the applicant is related to the business and if the applicant is a director and / or shareholder.  Where the applicant is a director and / or shareholder, further investigation of the business is to be completed (even where income from the business is not being used for serviceability assessment) to establish the below:

			<ul>
<li><span><span>When the applicant became a director;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>The percentage of shareholding; </span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the business is trading / non-trading; and</span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the business is profitable or able to able to service it's own commitments</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<sup> 1 </sup>  Where the applicant is either an Independent director or an Executive director they are not considered to be the business owner and do not need to be assessed as a self-employed applicant.

			<ul>
<li><span><span><b>Independent director</b>: A director that does not have a vested interest i.e. they are not a shareholder and the directorship is not held in a business that is owned (shareholding &gt; 0%) or controlled (directorship) by a spouse or family member (e.g. child or parent) or a subsidiary entity of the director or director's spouse / family member.</span></span><br/>
<span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><b>Executive director</b>: A director that does have a vested interest (a minor % shareholding of &lt;=5%) however limited to also being an independent PAYG employee.  E.g. the CEO of Westpac is a director but also an independent PAYG employee (PAYG employee of a business that is not their own business).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
