  </span></span>
<h3><a name="A_Why_this_policy"></a><strong><span><span><span>1.2 Why this policy</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span><span>This policy will help you in verifying existing commitments and repayment conduct.<br/>
<br/>
This is a key part of the unsuitability assessment and is required for every applicant who is either a borrower or income-reliant guarantor (WBC only), </span></span></span><span><span><span>or Self-employed with income assessed outside of OBP</span></span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span><span>Verification of the applicant's commitments ensures accurate information is used in completing a financial assessment and serviceability calculation.<br/>
<br/>
Repayment history on existing debts is considered to be a critical indicator of an applicant's credit worthiness and ability to meet commitments.<br/>
<br/>
This policy is applicable where the loan activity is a: </span></span></span>
<ul>
<li>New loan application</li>
<li>Loan increase</li>
<li>Any loan variation activity requiring a serviceability assessment</li>
</ul>
<span><span><span>You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to: </span></span></span>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000711"><em>Serviceability assessment</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000709"><em>Self-employed Customers</em></a></li>

</ul>
<span><span><span> <br/>
If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to </span><em><span>Lenders Mortgage Insurance</span></em></span></span><span><span><span> where required.   </span></span></span><br/>

<h2><a name="R_Rules_you_must_apply"></a><strong><span><span><span>2. Rules you must apply</span></span></span></strong></h2>
<h3><a name="R_Policy_exclusions"></a><strong><span><span><span>2.1 Policy exclusions</span></span></span></strong></h3>
  <span><span><span>This policy does not apply to a Bridging ICAP loan without an end debt.  </span></span></span><br/>
 
<h3><a name="R_Customer_commitments"><strong><span><span><span>2.2 Customer commitments</span></span></span></strong></a></h3>
<span><span><span>To ensure we accurately assess our customer's financial position we need to: </span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span>Collect information about their commitments.  </span></li>
<li><span>Verify the details of the commitment, refer to:  </span>
<ul>
<li><a href="#R_Confirm_the_details_of_the_commitment"><em><span>Confirm the details of the commitment </span></em></a></li>

</li>
</ul>
 

<h3><a name="R_Conflicting_information"><strong><span><span><span>2.3 Conflicting information</span></span></span></strong></a></h3>
<span><span><span>Further investigation may be required if we have identified any conflicts between any information (including Comprehensive Credit Bureau Report (CCR) data where applicable) and other supporting documents provided by the applicant.  Refer to </span></span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000699"><em>Loan Application and Approval &gt; Validation of information provided by the customer</em></a><br/>
<br/>
<span><span><span>In addition to the Commitments policy requirements, Brokers are reminded to complete the scrutiny activity as outlined in </span></span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000699"><em>Loan Application and Approval &gt; Validation of information provided by the customer</em></a><br/>

<span><span><b>Business commitments</b></span></span><br/>
<span><span>Where a business commitment is:</span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Held in a personal name, is not declared as a personal liability </span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Has been verified as accounted for in the entity tax returns / financials <b>and</b> </span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Has been included with the self-employed income assessment in the Broker Serviceability Calculator (for a partnership, company or trust) </span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span>This is not to be considered an undeclared liability or a CCR mismatch.</span></span><br/>
<br/>
<span><span>Where the self-employed entity is a sole trader:</span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>The commitment must be included as a personal liability of the individual (within OBP / ApplyOnline)</span></span></li>
</ul>
 

<h3><a name="R_Confirm_the_details_of_the_commitment"><strong><span><span><span>2.4 Confirm the details of the commitment</span></span></span></strong></a></h3>
<span><span><span>In all cases, the commitment details entered into the loan assessment system or calculator (e.g. OBP, Home Lending Toolkit) must match the information to be verified from CCR and/or a supporting document (where required), except where detailed in <a data-tagid="R_Allowable_variances" href="#R_Allowable_variances">Allowable Variances</a>.</span></span></span><br/>

<span><span><span>Where the origination platform requires input of additional information that is not mandatory to verify but is required for servicing, e.g. remaining loan term, this information can be sourced from one or more of the following sources / supporting documents:</span></span></span>

<br/>
			Chrisco and other hamper schemes are like a lay-buy as you have to buy your goods before you get them and can cancel the order.<br/>

			1) Loan Limit:<br/>
			2) Loan Interest Rate<br/>
