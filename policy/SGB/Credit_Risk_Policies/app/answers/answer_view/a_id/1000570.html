<h2><strong><span><span><a id="about" name="about"></a> 1. About this policy</span></span></strong></h2>
<h3> <a id="why" name="why"></a><strong><span><span>1.1 Why this policy</span></span></strong></h3>
 <span><span>This policy will help you determine which real estate and non-real estate securities we consider acceptable for consumer mortgages.<br/>
To determine the maximum loan to value ratio (LVR) and valuation requirement for each type of asset offered as security, refer to the </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000363"><em> </em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000555"><em>Assessing Loan to Value Ratio Policy</em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000363"><em> </em></a><span><span> and <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000560">Assessing Residential Security Value Policy. </a></span></span><br/>
 
<h3><strong><span><span>1.2 What is residential real estate security?<a id="what is" name="what is"></a></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>The Bank’s consumer mortgage lending policy is primarily directed towards standard residential real estate.<br/>
The security is to meet the objective of ensuring the borrower’s root of title, the Banks’ ability to register its mortgage and having marketable value sufficient to offset the Bank’s exposure during the term of the facility.<br/>
When assessing the market value of the security, the following factors are to be taken into account: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Downturn in market values resulting in decreased margins</li>
<li>Decrease in the present income stream with resulting serviceability and (capitalised) valuation problems</li>
<li>Increased impact on serviceability where highly geared proposals are concerned</li>
<li>The potential impact of any of the above occurring at any time during the Bank’s exposure is to be considered at the time of credit assessment.</li>
</ul>
<span><span>Under this policy, commercial real estate is not acceptable as security in a consumer loan.<br/>
Standard real estate includes houses, villas, units, vacant land zoned for residential use (up to 8 hectares) and others as defined in this policy.<br/>
We may also accept non-standard developments provided the customer meets certain conditions. Non-standard real estate is land or dwellings that are not typical for example: holiday resort-style accommodation or former commercial real estate converted into apartments.<br/>
For description or definition of each security type, refer to </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000255"><em> </em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000578"><em>Glossary </em></a><span><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000578">.</a><br/>

<h3><a id="2.1.1 overview – certificate of title" name="2.1.1 overview – certificate of title"><strong><span> 2.1.1 overview – certificate of title </span></strong></a></h3>
 <span><span>The certificate of title is a certificate issued subject to the Real Property Act, which certifies that the person named therein as the registered proprietor has title to the land described in the certificate. The original title is retained by the Lands Titles Office.<br/>
When assessing property for its acceptability as security for a new loan or loan variation we must obtain a title search to confirm root of title which includes identifying: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>The type of title</li>
<li>Who is the registered proprietor (the owner)</li>
<li>Any prior mortgage’s and their priority ranking</li>
<li>Any other restrictions or dealings registered on the title or lodged which could impact the Banks’ ability to register its mortgage or act on a mortgage once registered</li>
</ul>
<span><span>It is the responsibility of the assessor to obtain a copy of the title search and any dealings (registered or lodged) on the certificate of title prior to formal loan approval. The assessor must review the title search and any dealings to ensure the property is acceptable as security.<br/>
Assessor must confirm: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>the owners are exactly the same as the borrower, guarantor (if the property is already owned), or:</li>
<li>the vendor / transferrer as shown on the contract of sale and transfer description (when the property is being purchased).</li>
</ul>
<span> A purchase of a part ownership share in a property cannot be considered when all owners of the security offered, are not part of the loan application as either borrowers or guarantors.  In all instances the borrowers / guarantors must own or be purchasing (in the new loan application) 100% of the property and have exclusive use and occupation entitlement of the property used as supporting security.  </span><br/>
<span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong> When the security is a company title (or Moiety title), the borrowers / guarantors must own or be purchasing 100% of the shares associated with the specific unit offered as security and have exclusive use and occupation entitlement.<br/>
When the property is under a leasehold title, the borrowers / guarantors must be the same as the lessee, of the portion offered as supporting security and have exclusive use and occupation entitlement of the property used as supporting security. </span><br/>
<span><span>Credit approval will be required if any caveats, restrictive encumbrances, writs, notifications or dealings will remain post settlement of this loan (includes new lending on the security, increases or security variation).<br/>
If submitting a title to Credit to request approval for a caveat, restrictive encumbrance, writ, notification or dealing to remain on title, then a copy of the title and dealing must be provided to Credit for review and consideration of any limitations the dealing may impose.<br/>
If Credit approval has not been obtained, or the exception request has been declined, any caveats, restrictive encumbrances, writs, notifications or dealings must be removed prior to or simultaneously at loan settlement.</span></span><br/>

 <br/>
<span><span>The St.George Bank Group prefers to be the only mortgagee on a security property.  There may be some instances where we may take a second mortgage, for example, where the second mortgage is covering a shortfall in security by the primary property (eg Family Pledge Home loan option).</span></span><br/>
 <br/>
<span><span>A second mortgage may be taken where all of the below are met:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>The existing 1<sup>st</sup> mortgage is not for a reverse mortgage styled facility</li>
<li>The 1<sup>st</sup> mortgagee is a Financial institution, i.e. is not a private mortgage provider. Private mortgage providers include but are not limited to an individual, a solicitor, vendor finance.</li>
<li>LMI does not / will not apply to the proposed loan  (LMI is not available for second mortgage scenarios.  i.e. Where the first mortgage is not held by St.George, BankSA or Bank of Melbourne.) Refer to Assessing Loan to Value Ratio &gt; Assessing LVR by Security type.</li>
<li>The second mortgage is being taken to cover a shortfall of security only and the primary security property is being taken by / or is already held with St.George Bank Group registered as the 1<sup>st</sup> mortgagee.  Note: Applications  for new lending and / or increases (top-up) where a single security is being offered and STG/BSA/BoM will be 2<sup>nd</sup> Mortgagee are not able to be approved outside of Credit (or authorised credit delegate).</li>
<li>When calculating the LVR and determining the equity available for the new loan, a 20% buffer is added to the external mortgage limit (or priority amount when the external mortgagee has confirmed their priority amount).  You will need to take into account any existing loans, pledges or other liabilities already secured by the proposed second mortgage security property.</li>
<li>Details of the secured debts are verified as per <span>Commitments policy</span> </li>
<li>Second mortgage security has been confirmed as acceptable for the product type</li>
</ul>
<span><span><strong>Note</strong></span>: Westpac and RAMS are considered other financial institutions in terms of this policy.</span><br/>
<span><span>Brokers should advise the applicant(s) that second mortgage scenarios may lead to longer  settlement time frames that are outside of St.George Bank Group’s control.  Delays can occur when we write to the prior mortgagee seeking consent to register the second mortgage and we ask the prior mortgagee to establish their priority amount. </span></span><br/>
<span><span>A second mortgage may be approved by Credit or Assessor where they hold appropriate authority level.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>In all cases the Credit / Assessor loan application assessment notes must specifically acknowledge and reference approval for a second mortgage.  If approval for a second mortgage scenario is absent, any prior mortgages must be removed prior to or simultaneously at loan settlement.</span></span><br/>

<h3><strong><span><span><a id="third" name="third"></a>2.7 Assessing third party security</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>Third party security is when the bank is offered security by a person (or persons) that is not identical to the borrower/s. For example: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>The borrower is a company and the security is offered by the company directors</li>
<li>The security is owned by two people and is offered as security for a loan for only one of those two people.</li>
</ul>
<span><span>The Bank does not take a third party mortgage, but takes: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>A first party mortgage from all mortgagors, and</li>
<li>A guarantee from the mortgagors who are not borrowers.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong><span><span><a id="act" name="act"></a>2.10.3 ACT asbestos affected homes (“Mr Fluffy”)</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>Individual owners have been written to by the ACT Government outlining a government buy back offer.<br/>
This is due to ongoing public health and safety risks posed by the continuing presence of loose fill asbestos insulation in Canberra homes. Participation in the Buyback Program is voluntary and eligible home owners must lodge an application directly with the ACT Government taskforce by <strong><span>Tuesday, 30 June 2015</span></strong></span>.<br/>
If the owners take up the ACT Government offer, the intent is to demolish dwellings and remove the contamination then return the previously affected blocks back to the market for resale, with former owners (shown as at Tuesday, 28 October 2014 as the offer is not transferable), having a first right of refusal to purchase the affected block (at full market value, to be determined at the time of purchase) after it is remediated. Owners will be compensated by way of the ACT Government engaging two API accredited valuers to determine a market value of the property as if it were not affected by the loose fill asbestos, in order to establish the amount to be paid as ‘buy back’.<br/>
(Refer ACT Government web site for further background information. </span><a href="http://www.act.gov.au/asbestos-response-taskforce"> <em> </em><em>http://www.act.gov.au/asbestos-response-taskforce</em><em> </em> </a><span><span>.)<br/>
 <br/>
For the security to be acceptable the following conditions must be met: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>There is no current market for the sale and purchase of affected homes and therefore affected properties have a nil lending value until the ACT Government offer is made and accepted by the owners (as shown as at 28/10/14).</li>
<li>Only the ACT Government agreed security value is to be used as the security assessment. No other security assessment is to be relied on.</li>
<li>A copy of the ACT Government offer must be held as the security assessment.</li>
<li>Proof the ACT Government offer has been accepted by the customer must be held prior to full approval. Once accepted the value of the ACT Government offer is to be loaded into <em><span>clas</span></em> as “full valuation” using the “Company Name” of “Security Schedule”.</li>
<li>All Government conditions must be met e.g. customer can only be the registered owner as at 28/10/2014 as the offer is not transferable.</li>
</ul>
 

<h3><strong><span><span><a id="nsw" name="nsw"></a>2.10.4 NSW asbestos affected homes (“Mr Fluffy”)</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>In NSW, owners have two options:<br/>
a) Under <strong><span>Option 1</span></strong></span></span><span><span>, homeowners will be offered the value of the whole property (land and improvements).<br/>
b) Under <strong><span>Option 2</span></strong></span>, homeowners will be offered the value of the whole property minus the value of the land. For rural properties, homeowners will be offered the value of the affected premises and any building or structures on its curtilage. The curtilage is the area, usually enclosed, that encompasses the grounds and buildings immediately surrounding the premises that are used in daily domestic activities. The effect of this process is that homeowners are offered the value of the affected premises by itself.<br/>

  </span></span>
<h4><strong><span><span>a) If the customer accepts option 1.</span></span></strong></h4>
<span><span>Sale and discharge proceeds as normal.<br/>
However where the current owner wishes to purchase another property prior to receiving the purchase proceeds from the NSW Government and needs to fund all or part of the purchase price of the new property via a relocation loan from St.George Bank Group, such loan should be processed as a relocation loan with the following criteria: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Customer must show evidence that they have accepted the NSW Government offer Option 1 (i.e. sale of house and land) via signed License Agreement.</li>
<li>The security value of the asbestos affected property is the value listed in the NSW Government offer.</li>
<li>All other Product, Pricing and Credit rules remain unchanged.</li>
</ul>
 

<h4><strong><span><span>b) If the customer accepts option 2.</span></span></strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>Customer is required as part of the scheme to provide ‘written confirmation from any financial institution that holds an interest over the property that acknowledges my/our intent to proceed with Option 2.’ to the scheme i.e. Customer will contact St.George Bank Group to advise they have accepted option 2.</li>
<li>Security Variation Unit (SVU) team will receive customer notification and will acknowledge receipt to the customer.</li>
<li>Customer will then provide signed License Agreement to the SVU team.</li>
<li>When customer receives the funds from the scheme, they will be directed to contact the SVU team who will arrange reduction of balance and limit to a maximum of 80% of land value in the original NSW Government offer (i.e. NSW Government agreed security value for the land).</li>
<li>For re-construction of the property, customer will contact a lender to arrange new construction loan once customer has identified a builder. All normal lending criteria applies and the new Progress Draw loan will be processed as normal.</li>
</ol>
 

<h4><strong><span><span>Other information</span></span></strong></h4>
<span><span>For the security to be acceptable the following conditions must be met: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>There is no current market for the sale and purchase of affected homes and therefore affected house / unit properties have a nil lending value until the building is demolished and removed.</li>
<li>Only the NSW Government agreed security value for the land is to be used as the security assessment. No other security assessment is to be relied on.</li>
<li>A copy of the NSW Government offer must be held as the security assessment.</li>

<h3><strong><span><span><a id="use of term dep" name="use of term dep"></a>3.3 Use of Term Deposit</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>A Term Deposit can only be considered for a security substitution.<br/>
Term Deposits or Interest Bearing Deposits (IBD) held within the St.George Bank Group.<br/>
The following should be noted when considering acceptance of term deposit for a security substitution. </span></span>
<ul>
<li>A hold must be placed on the term/interest bearing deposit account to ensure funds are not released to, or accessed by, the customer(s) whilst the loan is still in existence</li>
<li>Acceptance of term deposit security is intended for instances where multiple securities are involved, including residential property, or where a simultaneous sale and purchase transaction cannot be arranged</li>
<li>The IBD’s term should be in line with the relocation loan term if being considered in conjunction with a relocation loan.</li>
<li>Any substitutions involving the taking of term deposit security will require individual assessment and approval by the Security Variations Unit, and Credit consent (where applicable)</li>
<li>Where the existing loan is not subject to mortgage insurance (MI) substitution term is available for 6 months.</li>
<li>For existing loans on which WLMI cover is in place (i.e. LVR ≤ 90%) and the loan's existing (residential) security is to be replaced in part or whole by cash security, prior consent from the insurer is to be sought in order to suspend cover pending a substitution for real estate occurring in the future. Suspension of existing LMI cover will only be considered under the following circumstances:
	<ul>
<li>Where a signed contract for the purchase of another residential property is held at the time of putting term deposit security in place; or</li>
<li>Up to a three month period from the date that term deposit security is accepted by the Bank as interim security pending its replacement with residential property; and</li>
<li>It is a clear substitution proposal and there are no additional borrowings (when replacing the term deposit with real estate); and</li>
<li>The residential real estate that will be brought on within 3 months is a 'like for like' property to the one originally insured by WLMI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For existing loans which are Genworth mortgage insured (i.e. LVR &gt; 90%) or effective 18/5/15 Arch Capital (WLMI-A), LMI cover is not available where this type of security is involved.</li>
<li>Where the loan type allows for interest capitalisation (e.g. Seniors Access) full proceeds must be taken at the time the existing residential security property is released. If the customer does not wish to provide full proceeds, then the existing loan is to be repaid. The customer can then consider establishing a new loan once a new property is identified.</li>
</ul>
<span><span>In all other cases where the above requirements cannot be met, any future substitution replacing the term deposit with a residential property that requires LMI will be subject to full assessment by the LMI provider, and a full premium being paid.<br/>
Any other non-real estate security is to be referred to the Credit Team for consideration prior to proceeding with an application.<br/>

<span><span>Participation in the scheme is voluntary for our customers and they can opt-out at any time. The scheme has been rolled out to all states in Australia. To facilitate this process, the owners execute a Deed of Donation with Homes for Homes who lodge a permissive caveat on the title. To register a Transfer of Ownership or Mortgage, a consent from Homes for Homes will be required to be provided to the LTO with our settlement documents for lodgement.<br/>
<br/>
The type of consent required by the LTO to accept the lodgement of our documents is specific to each state. To assist team members with understanding what information is required at settlement, a state based requirements matrix has been created.<br/>
<br/>
Where our customer does not wish to donate, they can request the Withdrawal of Caveat from the charity, which will need to be provided at settlement if the customer would like the bank to lodge it as part of our lodgement documents. </span></span>

<span>Removal of requirement for Second Mortgage Scenarios to be referred to Credit for approval.</span><br/>
<br/>
<strong><span><span>New content added to support authority level change</span></span></strong><br/>
<span><strong><span>Second Mortgage behind other financial institution (OFI)</span></strong></span><br/>
			 <br/>
<span><span>The St.George Bank Group prefers to be the only mortgagee on a security property.  There may be some instances where we may take a second mortgage, for example, where the second mortgage is covering a shortfall in security by the primary property (eg Family Pledge Home loan option).</span></span><br/>
			 <br/>
<span><span>A second mortgage may be taken where all of the below are met:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>The existing 1<sup>st</sup> mortgage is not for a reverse mortgage styled facility</li>
<li>The 1<sup>st</sup> mortgagee is a Financial institution, i.e. is not a private mortgage provider. Private mortgage providers include but are not limited to an individual, a solicitor, vendor finance.</li>
<li>LMI does not / will not apply to the proposed loan  (LMI is not available for second mortgage scenarios.  i.e. Where the first mortgage is not held by St.George, BankSA or Bank of Melbourne.) Refer to Assessing Loan to Value Ratio &gt; Assessing LVR by Security type.</li>
<li>The second mortgage is being taken to cover a shortfall of security only and the primary security property is being taken by / or is already held with St.George Bank Group registered as the 1<sup>st</sup> mortgagee. Note: Applications  for new lending and / or increases (top-up) where a single security is being offered and STG/BSA/BoM will be 2<sup>nd</sup> Mortgagee are not able to be approved outside of Credit (or authorised credit delegate).</li>
<li>When calculating the LVR and determining the equity available for the new loan, a 20% buffer is added to the external mortgage limit (or priority amount when the external mortgagee has confirmed their priority amount).  You will need to take into account any existing loans, pledges or other liabilities already secured by the proposed second mortgage security property.</li>
<li>Details of the secured debts are verified as per <span>Commitments</span> &gt; Verifying customer commitments matrix</li>
<li>Second mortgage security has been confirmed as acceptable for the product type</li>
</ul>
<span><span><strong>Note</strong></span>: Westpac and RAMS are considered other financial institutions in terms of this policy.</span><br/>
<span><span>Brokers should advise the applicant(s) that second mortgage scenarios may lead to longer  settlement time frames that are outside of St.George Bank Group’s control.  Delays can occur when we write to the prior mortgagee seeking consent to register the second mortgage and we ask the prior mortgagee to establish their priority amount. </span></span><br/>
<span><span>A second mortgage may be approved by Credit or Assessor where they hold appropriate authority level.</span></span><br/>
<span><span>In all cases the Credit / Assessor loan application assessment notes must specifically acknowledge and reference approval for a second mortgage.  If approval for a second mortgage scenario is absent, any prior mortgages must be removed prior to or simultaneously at loan settlement.</span></span><br/>
