<h2><strong><a id="ab" name="ab"></a> 1. About this policy</strong></h2>
<h3><br/>
<strong><a id="why" name="why"></a>1.1 Why this policy</strong></h3>
 <span><span>This policy outlines the requirements for making enquiries and capturing living expense information for each applicant that is contractually bound to repay the loan.<br/>
The customer declared living expenses are used by the Bank as part of the unsuitability assessment as required under our Responsible Lending obligations. <br/>
This policy is applicable where the loan activity is a: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>New loan application</li>
<li>Loan increase</li>
<li>Any servicing activity requiring a serviceability assessment</li>
</ul>
<span><span>You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to: </span></span>
<ul>

</ul>
<span><span>If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to </span></span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000381"><em> </em></a><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000579"><em>Lenders mortgage insurance (LMI) </em></a><span><span> where required.<br/>

<h2><strong><a id="rules" name="rules"></a>2. Rules you must apply</strong></h2>
<h3><br/>
<strong><a id="2.1 Living expenses - Overview" name="2.1 Living expenses - Overview"></a>2.1 Living expenses - Overview</strong></h3>
 <span><span>Living expenses materially affect the ability of a residential mortgage borrower to meet repayments due on a loan and are a key component of a serviceability assessment.<br/>
As part of the loan application process applicants are required to declare all</span></span> <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000578#H">household</a> <span><span> living expenses as at time of the application, as well as those which will be in place after settlement of their loan.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><span>Example </span></strong></span></span><br/>
<span><span>Our applicants have an owner occupier home loan with the Bank, the new application relates to the purchase of an investment property being funded by a new Investment Home Loan.  When assessing the applicant’s serviceability we need to consider not only the new mortgage repayments that will be incurred, but also expenses relating to the new investment property.<br/>
  </span></span>
<h3><strong><a id="2.2 Capturing customer declared living expenses" name="2.2 Capturing customer declared living expenses"></a>2.2 Capturing customer declared living expenses</strong></h3>
<span><span>It is critical that an appropriate level of enquiry is made in order to ensure an accurate view of the applicant’s declared living expenses are captured as part of the application process.<br/>
<br/>
Living expenses must be provided by the applicant and entered according to the set expense category (see </span></span><a href="#2.8 Expense category table"><em> table</em></a> b<em><span><span>elow</span></span></em><span><span>). It is not acceptable to 'bundle' across expense categories.<br/>
<br/>
The Broker is to assist the applicants by providing description of each expense category to ensure the applicants responses clearly align to our requirements.  Refer to </span></span><a href="#2.8 Expense category table"> <em>Expense Category table</em> </a><span><span>.<br/>
<br/>
Brokers cannot suggest a value on the applicant's behalf, except w</span></span> <span><span><span>hen rental income used in the serviceability assessment is</span></span></span><span><span><span> rental income (in AUD) from a property rented on a short term basis. </span></span></span> <span><span><span><span><span><span>If rental expenses relate to a property rented on a short term basis refer to: <a data-tagid="2.13 Rental expenses from a property rented on a short term basis" href="#2.13 Rental expenses from a property rented on a short term basis">Rental expenses from a property rented on a short term basis</a></span></span></span></span></span></span>

<h3><a id="2.3 Reducing living expenses" name="2.3 Reducing living expenses"></a><strong>2.3 Reducing living expenses</strong></h3>
<span><span>We acknowledge that a customer may change their spending behaviour following a change in circumstances (e.g. kids moving out of parent’s house) or when they have a new mortgage repayment obligation.<br/>
 <br/>
We accept that such change often involves a reduction in discretionary (non-essential) expenses such as recreation, entertainment, clothing, personal care and groceries. It is less likely that a customer can easily reduce expenses that are more stable by nature such as insurances, property-related costs, utilities, education and telephone.<br/>
 <br/>
Where the customer has told us that they are prepared to reasonably change their lifestyle to reduce living expenses, we may adjust customer declared expense amounts in the loan assessment system provided: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Broker has had a robust discussion with customer around their living expenses patterns; <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>The reduction appears reasonable; <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>Overall comments are recorded in ApplyOnline detailing the customer discussion including the reasons why the reductions were deemed acceptable by the broker.</li>
</ul>
<h3><br/>
<strong><span><span><a id="2.4 Conflicting information" name="2.4 Conflicting information">2.4 Conflicting information</a></span></span></strong></h3>
After the customer’s declared living expenses have been captured, we may need to make further enquiries with the applicant if:

<ul>
<li><span><span>during the assessment of the application we identify information which conflicts with the customer declared <b>non-discretionary expenses</b>. The conflict may be identified using data from Lender Assist  (where applicable) or other supporting documents provided by the applicant(s).  Refer to and follow the requirements as per <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000574"> Validation of information provided by the customer </a> policy &gt; Document review – what to look for (table) &gt; <span>Any inconsistencies or omissions in customer declared expenses where the expense type is <b>non-discretionary</b></span>; or</span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>where the declared living expenses &lt; 70% of HEM, Brokers / Assessors must refer to and follow the requirements as per <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000562"> Serviceability Assessment </a> policy &gt; Customer declared living expenses are &lt; 70% of HEM</span></span></span></span></span></li>

The application must reflect the actual post settlement postcode for formal approval. </span></span><br/>
<span>Living expenses should be captured as whole dollars (no cents). </span><br/>

<br/>
<span>   When rental income used in the serviceability assessment is       rental       income (in AUD) From a property rented on a short term basis and this property was rented for the full 52 weeks of the year. The expenses declared on the rental schedule other that interest, depreciation and once off capital expenses must be used.    </span><br/>
<span>   Where the short-term rental property has not been rented for the full 52 weeks of the year, expenses incurred when the property is not rented are to be entered into customer expenses either as an owner occupied primary or owner-occupied secondary expenses. The lender should discuss with the customer to determine whether the property is owner occupied primary or owner occupied secondary and document accordingly.    </span><br/>
<span>   If the property is owner-occupied and has a separate area of occupancy (granny flat) being used for short term rent, the owner-occupied portion of expenses is to be separated from the investment portion. Like above, the investment portion can be determined from the rental schedule in the tax return and the owner-occupied portion can be determined through a customer conversation.   </span>

<td><span><span>Are regular Chrisco payments (and other similar hamper scheme arrangements) to be captured as a living expense or a commitment?</span></span></td>
<td><span><span>Capture as an expense.<br/>
			Chrisco and other hamper schemes are like a lay-buy as you have to buy your goods before you get them and can cancel the order.<br/>
			In that way they are different from a credit card and buy now pay later schemes like AfterPay and ZipPay. </span></span></td>

<tr>
<td><span><span>How do we record expenses for self-employed applicants where, for example, the company pays for some expenses like phone and internet? If lenders enter amounts as expenses, isn’t this double dipping?</span></span></td>
<td><span><span>Self-employed applicants cannot claim personal expenses as part of the business expenses. Anything spent from company accounts and used for personal purposes needs to be called out as a separate entry in the business or company tax returns.<br/>
			As personal expenses cannot legally be claimed within the business there should be no double dipping occurring.</span></span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span><span>Why do we need to include Owner Occupied or Investment Property expenses (Rates, Electricity, water etc.) when the property has not been purchased? </span></span></td>
<td><span><span>The customer will have these ongoing expenses after they purchase the property which will impact serviceability.<br/>
			Usually customers are provided estimates of rates etc on the real estate brochure.<br/>
			When customers are purchasing a home, especially when they are first home buyers, the expert, being the Lender, should be discussing with them the other costs they will incur once the property has been purchased.<br/>
			It is possible they have never had to pay an electricity or water bill, or considered property rates and or strata fees they would need to pay.<br/>
			In discussing these additional costs with the customer, we make them aware of costs other than the loan repayment that they would need to budget for.</span></span></td>
