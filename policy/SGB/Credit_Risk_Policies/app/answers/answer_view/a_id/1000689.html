			<td valign="top"><span><span><span>A construction loan, also known as a building loan or a TBE (To-Be-Erected) loan, is a specialised lending option that provides a borrower and their builder, funding throughout the process of constructing or renovating a property.</span></span></span><br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<span><span><span>This policy identifies the structure required for a home loan where the borrowers would like to use the funds for residential building purposes.<br />
			<br />
			The loan proceeds can be used to fund the construction of one or more residential dwellings (subject to </span></span></span><span><em><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000683">Acceptable Security Collateral</a></span></em></span><span><span><span> ) or undertake home improvements (renovations) to an already established property, where the property is also security for the proposed loan.<br />
			<br />
			The main feature is the loan proceeds are paid in progressive payments to the builder during the construction phase. The frequency and percentage / amount of the progress payment being advanced can be affected by the type of security property and nature of the building contract.<br />
			<br />
			The construction can be completed by way of a Licensed Builder or an Owner Builder.</span></span></span><br />

<h3><a name="R_Additional_building_work_outside_of_th"></a><strong><span><span><span>2.5 Additional building work outside of the primary builder's fixed price contract</span></span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>A Licensed Builder's fixed price contract may incorporate the completion of all required building work. However, it is acceptable for the applicant to provide separate contracts or quotes for additional work to be completed as a part of the loan application.<br />
<br />
If these works are being funded by the Bank and the valuer has considered these improvements when arriving at a 'TBE' (To Be Erected) valuation figure of the property, the Bank must control funds to ensure this work is completed.<br />
<br />
The following items are examples of additional works which may be completed by an external contractor other than the primary builder: </span></span>

<ul>
	<li>Air conditioning</li>
	<li>Carpets</li>
	<li>Curtains</li>
	<li>Driveways</li>
	<li>Fences</li>
	<li>Flooring</li>
	<li>Landscaping</li>
	<li>Paving</li>
	<li>Pergolas</li>
	<li>Security System</li>
	<li>Swimming Pool</li>
	<li>Window furnishing</li>
</ul>
<span><span><span><b>External Tradespeople quotes above fixed price build contract or renovations using multiple builders or contractors:</b></span></span></span><br />
<span><span><span>A maximum of 5 quotes can be accepted without referral to Credit, where the applicant:</span></span></span>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Has a fixed price contact with a single licensed builder to manage the construction or renovation, <b>and</b></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The construction or renovation is less than or equal to $1m*, <b>and</b></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>External tradespeople / contractors are used for additional work outside of the fixed price contract</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span><span><span><b><span>OR</span></b></span></span></span></span>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Is sourcing individual tradespeople to complete renovations rather than engaging a single builder to manage renovations. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span><span><span><span>*For fixed price contract greater than $1m, there is no limit to the maximum number of quotes as each progress payment (including quotes) requires a progress inspection, refer </span><a data-tagid="R_Progress_Inspections" href="#R_Progress_Inspections">Progress Inspections</a></span></span></span></span><br />
<span><span><span><b>Note</b>: If more than 5 quotes the application is to be referred to Credit to consider any additional requirements (e.g. treat as owner builder in terms of this policy).</span></span></span><br />
