<h3><strong><span><span><a id="add" name="add"></a>2.5 Additional building work outside of the primary builder’s fixed price contract</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>A Licensed Builder’s fixed price contract may incorporate the completion of all required building work. However, it is acceptable for the applicant to provide separate contracts or quotes for additional work to be completed as a part of the loan application.<br/>
If these works are being funded by the Bank and the valuer has considered these improvements when arriving at an ‘as if complete’ valuation figure of the property, the Bank must control funds to ensure this work is completed.<br/>
The following items are examples of additional works which may be completed by an external contractor other than the primary builder: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Air conditioning</li>
<li>Carpets</li>
<li>Curtains</li>
<li>Driveways</li>

<h3><a id="cost" name="cost"><strong><span><span>2.6 Cost-Plus (non-fixed price) Contracts</span></span></strong></a></h3>
<h5><strong><span><span>Definition</span></span></strong></h5>
<span><span>Cost plus contracts can be identified because they do not state the total cost of the build and may only provide a 'budgeted cost to complete', 'Cost plus a percentage' or may show the cost of the works plus allow a margin for labour or even building material cost increases.<br/>
The amount due to the builder is the actual cost incurred by the contractor plus a percentage of that cost, or the cost incurred plus an hourly rate for the contractor.<br/>
As materials are not a fixed price, the overall cost of the contract can vary. This can result in a significant increase in the contract price prior to or during construction and therefore may adversely affect the Bank’s lending and security position. </span></span>
<h5><strong><span><span>Requirements</span></span></strong></h5>
<span><span>Cost plus contract: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Evidence the borrower’s funds to complete prior to formal approval (refer to <a href="#borrowers contr"><em> Borrower’s contribution </em></a>)</li>

<li>The loan must also be sent to Credit for consideration.</li>

<li>upgrades are made, then the customers must ensure that they have access to sufficient funds to pay for any increase in the cost of construction. For example the borrower wants to substitute a more expensive type of tap wear.</li>
<li>down-grades are made, then the customers must notify the Bank as the variations to the contract may impact the valuation of the property.  For example original building contract included ducted air-conditioning and the customers ask the builder to not proceed with purchase and installation of the air-conditioning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The valuer may require a Quantity Surveyor (QS) report.</li>

<li>Advise the borrower:
	<ul>
<li>Funding in advance is not available. Funds are released against the cost to complete as advised by our panel valuer. Release of funds is based on the items being affixed to the site. Eg The borrower wishes to purchase the bricks ready to construct the walls. Payment can only be made after the bricks are affixed in place.</li>
<li>For any variation to cost estimates after the loan’s first advance, borrower/s should ensure they have sufficient funds to cover the difference from the original contract (where there is an increase in costs to construct)</li>
<li>the panel valuer may request additional documentation to support the ‘as if complete’ valuation and this will be set out in the valuation report. This may include:
		<ul>
<li>A Quantity Surveyor (QS) report</li>
<li>Engineer’s details re slab/footings</li>
<li>Engineer’s Certificate re slab/footings</li>
<li>Pest treatment or pest prevention confirmation</li>
<li>Roof truss details from manufacturer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inform the borrowers for properties located in NSW: Before the final progress payment the Bank requires to sight a copy of the updated Survey Report showing the position of the improvements in relation to the boundaries, and that all improvements comply with the Local Government Ordinances (The survey should be updated after completion of eaves and guttering) or Certificate of Occupancy. Prior to the first progress payment the Bank may request to sight the survey report showing the location of the footings/slab (or the pegged out survey).</li>
</ul>
<span><span>In all cases the Broker is to ascertain the borrower’s experience and background to undertake the construction, and provide notes in their submission accordingly.<br/>
Within assessment notes the Broker is to comment on any large variations between Owner Builder cash flow statement and Panel Valuer check costs shown on the valuation report. Check costs are the Valuer’s estimates of the cost of the project under contract builder conditions. There should be a demonstrable cost benefit for the Owner builder project v’s completing the transaction via a Licensed builder.<br/>

<h3><a id="house" name="house"><strong><span><span>2.12 House/land Package Deals</span></span></strong></a></h3>
<span><span>There are different types of House and Land packages, Standard house and land packages or “Turn Key” style house and land package or Multi Unit Residential Developments. </span></span>
<h5><strong><span><span>Standard house and land package</span></span></strong></h5>
<span><span>Applicants choose a block of land and house from a range of building plan options offered by the builder. Applicants may have a choice of builders if the land is being purchased from a developer. The builder may be completing additional items like air-conditioning, carpeting, landscaping etc. When determining the market value on an ‘As If Complete’ basis, the valuation will reflect separate values for the land and improvements.<br/>
These applications can proceed as a normal construction (building) loans with progress payments. </span></span>
<h5><strong><span><span>“Turn Key” House and Land Packages or Multi Unit Residential Developments</span></span></strong></h5>
<span><span>With a “Turn Key” style house and land package the property is purchased as one parcel and contracts can be entered into for the purchase either on completion of the home, before construction commences or once construction is complete.<br/>
The applicant is not able to choose their own builder and settlement does not take place until after completion of construction.<br/>
These are treated as purchase on-completion applications. Funds will not be made available for the purchase until the property has been completed. Progress payments <strong><span>will not</span></strong></span> be made during the construction period<br/>
Applications may be assessed on an Approval in Principal basis to complete the ‘not unsuitable’ assessment.

A short-form valuation is required to confirm the property’s value against the new (amended) Council Approved Plans and Specifications.<br/>

<li>Any shortfall of funds (<a href="https://sites.thewestpacgroup.com.au/sites/TS846/Shared%20Documents/Broker%20Manual%20Chapters%20SBG/6.%20Final%20versions%20-%20changes%20accepted/03.05%20Building%20Loans.docx#BK68926639"><em> </em></a><a href="#Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security"><em>Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security</em></a><a href="#Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security"><em> </em></a>) will require broker follow up.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Progress Payments Team must have issued a Commence Building Operations Authority. This occurs once certificate of title has been certified, settlement requirements have been met and there is no evidence of shortfall.

<h5><strong><span><span>Owner Builder</span></span></strong></h5>
<span><span>Owner Builder progress payment stages are not pre-determined.<br/>
When the borrower requests a progress payment, an inspection by the Bank's panel valuer is required, prior to any payment being released.<br/>
Inspections are compulsory prior to the release of any funds on all Owner Builder loans and, they must be carried out by a panel valuer. Each inspection report will determine the value of the work completed to date.<br/>
At all times, sufficient loan funds are retained to ensure practical completion of the dwelling based on the owner builder’s original cost to complete and valuer’s assessment of completed work.<br/>
Assessment is based only on works completed/materials fixed to site, and not materials purchased or delivered to site.  For example the Owner Builder may have just completed the pouring of the slab and request the first progress payment.  In addition they have purchased the bricks and roof tiles and had them delivered to the construction site.  The Bank will only reimburse the customer for the slab, because the bricks and roof tiles have not been installed and are not fixed to site. </span></span>
<h5><strong><span><span>Inspection fees – Owner builder</span></span></strong></h5>
<span><span>A total of four inspection fees are to be collected from the borrowers together with the applicable establishment fee.<br/>
Additional inspection fees will be debited to the loan account and will be processed by the Progress Payments Team </span></span>
<h5><a name="_Licenced_Builder"></a><strong><span><span>Licenced Builder contracts</span></span></strong></h5>
<strong><span><span>Standard vs. Non Standard Schedule of Payments</span></span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<span><span><strong>Standard</strong><br/>
Progress payment schedules are considered to be 'Standard' where the valuer makes a comment within the valuation commentary to indicate they are 'to industry standard', or makes no comment.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Non Standard</strong><br/>
If the valuer comments the schedule of payments are 'not to industry standard', then <strong><span>you must </span></strong></span>request a new schedule of payments from the Builder when the below conditions apply</span>:

<ul>
<li>The schedule already held does not meet the table<sup>1</sup> below, <strong>and</strong>
<ul>
<li>The application is Mortgage Insured or;</li>
<li>The application is Non-mortgage insured loan <strong><span>with any risk rating ≥ 4</span></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<span><span>No action is required when the valuer comments 'not to industry standard' but the above conditions are not triggered.<br/>
<br/>
When required to obtain a new schedule of payments, all of the below apply: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Deposit</li>
<li>Foundations</li>
<li>Frame</li>
<li>External Lining</li>
<li>Lockup/Internal Lining</li>
<li>Practical Completion</li>
</ul>
<span><span>The schedule of payments must comply with the below table: </span></span>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="633">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong><span><span><sup><a id="Progress Payment Stage table" name="Progress Payment Stage table"></a>1</sup> Progress Payment Stage</span></span></strong></td>

<span><span>The above table ensures that a builder allocates the appropriate level of funds at each stage of the build, ensuring the construction is completed.<br/>
The application may not proceed to formal approval until a compliant schedule of payments is held. </span></span>
<h5><strong><span><span>Incomplete Securities</span></span></strong></h5>
<span><span>For non-mortgage insured applications only<br/>
If a request for a final stage payment is received and the final inspection report indicates that there is work outstanding (i.e. not completed to contract specifications), the final payment will only be released with the correct approvals.  </span></span>

<h3><a id="qs" name="qs"><strong><span><span>2.20 Quantity Surveyor (QS) Report</span></span></strong></a></h3>
<span><span>For all Acceptable Building T</span></span><span><span>ypes</span></span><span><span>, the Valuer at their discretion may request a Quantity Surveyor (QS) report. When the Valuer has requested a QS report, a quantity surveyor is to be engaged by the borrower/s at their expense. <strong>Note: when the valuer has requested a Quantity Surveyor report, this cannot be waived.  </strong></span></span><br/>
<span><span>Typically, a Valuer will only request a QS report when the construction is considered to be unusual. Common instances when this may occur include (but are not limited to):</span></span>
<ul>
<li>Owner builder constructions</li>
<li>Building sites with complexities (e.g., site access complication, steeply sloping environmental issues / flooding).</li>
<li>High build cost per square metre</li>
<li>Building contracts with non-industry standard progress schedules e.g.
	<ul>
<li><span><span>A progress schedule that is time based (e.g., monthly payments to the builder that do not relate to work completed)</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>A progress schedule that requires payments to be paid, for partially completed works / stages. </span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span><span>Constructions with unusual designs (e.g. where valuer has few peers in the building market to draw reasonable rate cost conclusions). </span></span><span><span>For further information as to what is considered ‘unusual’ refer to Assessing acceptable securities &gt; rules you must apply &gt; </span></span><em><span><span><span><span>Assessing security requirements – standard real estate</span></span></span></span></em><span><span> &gt; Residential dwelling to be erected. </span></span></li>
</ul>
<div>When the Quantity Surveyor report has been provided the lender / assessor must archive a copy with the loan file and provide a copy to the valuer.</div>
<span><span>The applicant can contract with a QS of their choice with the following conditions: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>QS must be member of <a href="http://www.aiqs.com.au/"><em> Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors </em></a>.</li>
<li>Customer must cover all costs associated with obtaining the QS reports.</li>
<li>Whenever a progress payment is requested, if the valuer requires a Quantity Surveyor report, the customer must provide this to the bank.</li>
</ul>
<span><span>If Home Ownership Services identifies that cost to complete project exceeds remaining undrawn loan balance, the application will be referred back to the broker. Refer to </span></span><a href="https://sites.thewestpacgroup.com.au/sites/TS846/Shared%20Documents/Broker%20Manual%20Chapters%20SBG/6.%20Final%20versions%20-%20changes%20accepted/03.05%20Building%20Loans.docx#BK68926639"><em> </em></a><a href="#Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security"><em>insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security </em></a><span><span><a href="#Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security">.<br/>
 </a><br/>
A QS Report must include: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>The cost benefit of completing the construction on an owner builder basis.</li>
<li>The total cost of to complete the project.</li>
<li>The site stages must add up to the total cost of the project.</li>
</ul>
<span><span> <br/>
The QS Report provided at progress inspections is to cover: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Evidence that work completed is according to industry standards.</li>
<li>Cost of work completed to date.</li>
<li>A comparison with original costing.</li>
<li>Estimate of expenditure required to complete project.</li>
</ul>
<span><span>Progress payments will not be released unless QS report received and reviewed.<br/>

<h3><strong><span><span><a id="settlement period" name="settlement period"></a>2.21 Settlement period - building loans</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>‘Settlement’ for all building loans is defined as the first draw down (i.e. for land settlement) or where no initial draw is to occur, satisfactory completion of all the Bank’s legal requirements to register a mortgage over the land and funds are ready to be made available.<br/>
For Construction Loans (Contract Builder/Owner Builder):</span></span>
<ul>
<li>Initial draw down is to occur within 12 months of the Loan offer date and;</li>
<li><span><span>Completion of construction and/or final progress payment is to be made within twenty four (24) months of the loan offer date (or 12 months where the construction loan is part of a relocation loan).</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span><span>  </span></span>
<h3><strong><span><span><a id="buildinmg loans not fully" name="buildinmg loans not fully"></a>2.22 Building loans not fully drawn within twenty four months of the loan offer date</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>It is a condition of the loan on all residential building loan proposals, including Owner Builder loans, that construction is completed and loan is fully advanced within twenty four (24) months of the Loan offer date (or 12 months where the construction loan is part of a Relocation Loan).<br/>
Failure to do so may mean the Bank refuses to make any further loan advances.<br/>
If requested by the Bank, the borrower/s will be required to provide an estimated date of completion and a reason for the delay, in order to determine continued support for the extended construction period. Progress Payment Teams will monitor loan accounts.<br/>

<h3><strong><span><span><a id="progress payments" name="progress payments"></a>3.1 Progress Payments</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>As each stage of the construction is completed the following must occur prior to the progress payment funds being released:</span></span>
<ul>
<li>Each borrower must sign the Progress Payment Request that states that they are satisfied with the work completed.</li>
<li>Request for progress payment forwarded to Progress Payment Team for processing</li>

<span><span>Where multiple stage payments (more than one stage payment at a time) are received, the Progress Payment Team will contact the borrower, and confirm that work has been completed.<br/>
When the borrower/s confirms that the builder has completed the work, the requested stage payments will be made.<br/>
If the borrower/s do not require the stage payments, the Progress Payment officer will destroy the surplus claim forms.<br/>
Borrower/s will be advised to re-submit upon satisfactory completion of the construction stage.<br/>

<span><span>Brokers are requested to ascertain the type of work to be completed i.e. internal renovation, new kitchen, bathroom, pool, extension etc., and note in ApplyOnline commentsaccordingly.For these proposals, payments will be made upon receipt of the supplier’s invoice together with our application for progress payment form duly authorised by our customer/s.

<br/>
<span><span>Where work is to be undertaken under an ‘as if complete’ valuation over and above the fixed price building contract, and the valuer has included these additional works in arriving at a figure for the ‘as if complete’  value of the property, then the Bank must control funds to ensure this work is completed. Brokers are required to determine the type of additional work and note in ApplyOnline comments indicating the following: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Builders tender/contract amount and the itemised listing of additional works and costs over and above the contract amount;</li>
<li>Details of the supplier/sub-contractor undertaking the additional work i.e. electrical work, pool, air-conditioning, carpets etc. if available; and</li>
<li>Any other special conditions that need to be considered i.e. property inspection requirements other than the final property inspection.</li>
</ul>
<span><span>For these proposals, payments will be paid directly to the supplier / sub-contractor once works have been completed and our customer/s have provided a signed authorisation to action and the relevant invoice. Additional build work needs to be noted as per above.<br/>
By brokers following the above steps this will ensure that no shortfalls occur, funds are being released direct to suppliers / contractors and our control points are consistent for the disbursement of funds as per the loan approval.<br/>
