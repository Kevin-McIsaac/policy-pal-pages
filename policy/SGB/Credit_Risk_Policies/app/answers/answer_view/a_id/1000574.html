			For example, the biller might be: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>a financial institution our customer has a debt to (a Commitment)</li>
<li>a real estate agency our customer pays rent to (a Commitment)</li>
<li>a strata management company our customer pays strata fees to (a Living expense)</li>

			If the associated transaction narrative for the DEFT debit: </span></span>
<ul>

<li><strong><span>Does evidence the nature of the payment:</span></strong></li>

<b> Action to take </b>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Clarify any potential undisclosed liabilities / outgoings or any potential information that conflicts with the customers application</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Amend or update the application to reflect the customer’s position. Re-complete assessments, verifications where required and re-run credit decision if required</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Enter application comments detailing the outcome of all related customer discussions. This will provide an audit trail and prevent rework</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Enter a final comment in the application confirming the account scrutiny activity has been completed.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<b>New table added</b> with what we need to look for when reviewing transactions and other supporting documents (included Examples and Action to take) for:

			<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Undisclosed commitments</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Non-discretionary expenses</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Conflicting information</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<b> Change 3 </b><br/>
			Deleted entire subsection ‘ 3. Examples’<br/>
			Remaining sub section have been renumbered as a result of the removal of content<br/>
			 <br/>
<b>Change 4 </b><br/>
			Update to content in 3. Credit Bureau commitment mismatch, scenario table. Scenario 3 - The credit bureau report shows a facility but the borrower forgot they had the facility and did not declare it.<br/>
			The ‘action’ column has been split to show different outcomes where:<br/>
			Where the credit bureau report contains:
			<ul>
<li><span><span><b>a maximum of one</b> undisclosed / undeclared debt (facility) <b>and</b> the debt is <b>either</b>:</span></span>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span> a Credit Card <b>or</b></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span> an Overdraft (unsecured / non-mortgage)</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><b>and </b>the current months repayment history status* displays a 0 (zero) refer to and follow the additional requirements.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
			Versus<br/>
			Where the credit bureau report contains:
			<ul>
<li><span><span>&gt; 1 undisclosed / undeclared credit card <b>or</b> overdraft (unsecured / non-mortgage); <b>or</b></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>The Credit Card <b>or</b> an Overdraft (unsecured / non-mortgage)  current months repayment history status does not display a 0 (zero); <b>or</b></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>The undisclosed / undeclared debt (facility) is not a credit card <b>or</b> overdraft (unsecured / non-mortgage)</span></span></span></span></span></li>
