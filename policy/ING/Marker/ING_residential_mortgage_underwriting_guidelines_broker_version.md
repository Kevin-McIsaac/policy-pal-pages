#### 2.2. Mixed Parties

| Mixed Parties | Mixed parties are where borrowers have an interest in the primary security property, but not all parties have an interest in all security properties. |
| --- | --- |
|  | For example: A and B are borrowers and mortagaors on Property 1 (loan/mortagae security/property). Only A are mortagaors on Property |
|  | 2 (supporting security). There is no third party as all borrowers are mortgagors. The incomes of A and B must be included in servicing. Where borrowers rely on mortgage security provided by: |
|  | ● Borrowers and a third-party or |
|  | · A third-party only, |
|  | The borrowers must pass servicing without any reliance on the third-party's income. |
|  | For example: Mr Jones wants to be the only borrower to purchase an investment property, using an owner occupied home owned by both Mr |
| Third-party | & his wife Mrs Jones. |
| security | In this case, the third-party (Mrs Jones) must be a quarantor and a recommendation must be made that the proposed quarantor obtain |
|  | independent legal advice and if required, financial advice. (see Section 2.7) |
|  | The quarantor (where third party security) must be a parent, child, de facto/spouse, company, Aunt or Uncle, or Parent-in-low of the |
|  | borrower. |
|  | An assessment of the financial strength and assets & liabilities of the third party quarantor must evidence that the quarantor will not |
|  | suffer substantial hardship if the security is called upon. |

# 2.3. Borrowers of convenience / Substantial Benefit

| ING |  |
| --- | --- |
| Borrowers of | Borrowers of convenience are where borrowers income is insufficient, so an additional borrower is added to pass servicing. For example: Borrowers A, B, and C apply for a loan for A and B to buy a property. C is a borrower of convenience and unacceptable, |
| convenience |  |
|  | unless where borrower C can establish a substantial benefit. |
| . | All borrowers must have a substantial benefit in entering the loan. |
|  | Acceptable Unacceptable |
|  | A substantial benefit can be established where all borrowers: . Borrowers of convenience are unacceptable when the co- |
| ● | Each hold >=20% shareholding on title borrower is not in a married or de facto relationship and |
|  | OR derives little to no benefit from the transaction (less than |
| ● | Must be in a married or de facto relationship with each other and 20%). |
| Substantial | provide a satisfactory explanation for the structure (e.q. asset |
|  | protection or taxation purposes) |
| Benefit | OR |
| ● | Equal share when >=6 borrowers. |

# 2.4. Family Support

| ING |  | Family Support allows a borrower/'s with a shortfall in savinqs (to meet LVR requirements), the ability to purchase or refinance property with |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | assistance of "Family member/'s" as quarantor Family member includes a spouse, de facto partner, child (including adopted or step child), |
|  |  | parent, grandparent, or sibling of an applicant. |
| Family |  | This section applies to family member as Guarantee and mortqaqe for security support only. Refer procedure for IBAL's requirements when |
| Support | taking a quarantee. |  |
|  |  | Family members are also eliqible as co-borrower/mortgaqor (see standard credit policy). |
|  | Product |  |
|  | Availability | Family support is only available on a P & I basis. |
|  | . | Funding to a maximum of 100% of purchase price. |
|  | . | Maximum 80% LVR and No LMI. |
|  | . | Cash out or consolidation of debts is unacceptable (includinq credit cards/ other debts, or refinance of a partially |
|  |  | constructed property). |
|  | Requirements ● | Family support is eligible for one borrower and one property. It is acceptable for quarantors to mortqage multiple |
|  |  | properties. |
|  | ● | A financial assessment is required of the quarantor's financial position both now and what could be reasonably expected in |
|  |  | the future if the primary borrower were to default on the loan (This could take into account such issues as age, asset |
|  |  | position and a "fall back" position for the guarantor should a default occur). |
|  |  | Refinance using family support requires: |
|  | . Additional | The existing loan structure with the current lender is under similar parameters (i.e. same borrowers, security and |
|  | requirements | quarantors if any). A copy of the Letter of Offer or Loan Contract for the current facility must be provided for confirmation. |
|  | ● | Refinance of existing home loan only, with maximum additional funds to cover refinancinq costs (up to $5,000). Any redraw |
|  | for Refinance | with the existing lender, can be included in the refinance and is not classified as cash out. |
|  |  | All quarantors must obtain new independent legal advice and if required, financial advice. |

|  |  | Where security support by a family member, borrowers must be able to service the loan in their own right. |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | • | IBAL's preferred position is for the guarantee to equal all amounts owing under the loan plus other categories of liabilities |
|  |  | such as interest and costs. |
| Family | • Security | Limited guarantees can be considered only where requested by customer/broker, provided the amount is sufficient for |
| Support | Support Only | security support. Minimum amount of guarantee would be total loan amount less maximum security support (LVR) of |
| continued |  | primary security amount. Example: A Loan amount of $450,000, less $400,000 (80% of Property Value $500,000) equals |
|  |  | $50,000 (Required amount of guarantee). |
|  |  | The maximum LVR where family member security support is 33% of the property value plus any other IBAL borrowings. (i.e. |
|  |  | Maximum loan amount is primary security @ 80% LVR plus support security @ 33% LVR. |

# **2.5. Favourable purchases (Gift in equity)**

| ING |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | A favourable purchase (Gift in equity) is where finance for a security property is being "purchased" at a lower price below market value. |

| equity) | • Borrower's must provide an ING Gift Statutory Declaration from the vendor stating that the equity in the property is being gifted and is not |
|  | subject to being repaid at any time in the future by the child or person receiving the gift. Any gift that provides a borrower(s) with a deposit (equity to reduce LVR) or where known the purchase is a 100% gift requires a ING Gift |
|  | Statutory Declaration from the gift provider, stating that any monies/property are a non-refundable, non-repayable gift. Note: The form must also contain any necessary Privacy Act requirements. |

|  | Any variation >10% between the purchase price and the valuation (e.g. as a result of two tier marketing, or related party purchases) |  |  |  |
|  | requires a detailed assessment. |  |  |  |
|  | Where the valuation amount is less than the purchase price of the subject property by 10% or more, the borrower needs to be promptly |  |  |  |
|  | informed and qiven the option to either proceed or withdraw the loan application and the opportunity to seek independent advice before |  |  |  |

|  | valuation is for our internal use, and you are not entitled to rely on it. In the light of this information, we strongly recommend that you make independent |  |  |  |
|  | enquiries as to the value of the property. It is common for value slightly below purchase price, and of course, the assessment by our valuer may |  |  |  |
|  | have been unusually conservative or based on incomplete information. This underlines the importance of you making your own enquiries. By proceeding to |  |  |  |
|  | drawdown the loan, you acknowledge you are aware of this issue and wish to borrow the loan despite this fact." |  |  |  |

|  | to clear all loans secured by that security. |
|  | Partial discharqes can be approved provided the residual debt is within the approving staff member limit. |
|  | Servicing |
|  | Serviceability is not required where LVR remains the same or decreases and is within product parameters. |
|  | Note: Assessment of servicing can be considered where: |
|  | · Full sale proceeds are not obtained. |
| . | Property being released is deriving rental return. |
| . | Doubt exists as to the validity of the transaction (E.g. non arm's length sales, sales not involving a Real |
|  | Estate Agent). |
| . | Where arrears history is evident (greater than 1 payment in arrears (greater than 30 days) in the last 6 |
|  | months) or where there is evidence that the customer has been in hardship in the previous 12 months |

|  |  | A Full Assessment is to be considered where new security property is not in a primary postcode. |
|  |  | It is important to consider whether the proposed switch will impact or change a borrower's repayment arrangement. Therefore, in some |
|  |  | circumstances it is appropriate that we confirm a borrower's ability to maintain P&I payments on an ongoing basis. |
|  | • | Switching between product types do not require a servicing assessment: |

| --- | --- |
|  | IBAL will consider lending for residential products in any Australian postcode. |
|  | The acceptable postcode list includes |
|  | Primary Postcodes with a sub section for both Exception and No Go Postcodes. о |
|  | Primary Postcodes are classified as Cateqory 1, 2 and 3 to rank reqional areas and used to identify restrictions for loans with LMI |
|  | approved under DUA. |
|  | The exception postcodes cover where lendinq restrictions are imposed on units/apartments within that postcode for a particular |
|  | reason e.q. inner city/core or fringe CBD apartments, areas where oversupply exists, areas affected by disasters etc. For this reason, |
|  | they must undergo greater scrutiny at assessment and with a heightened level of review on the valuation. |
| Postcode categories | No Go postcodes are locations where IBAL Risk Management have identified areas of concern over the location and may wish to |
|  | prevent any increased exposure to the location. Any new or increased loans secured by properties in a No Go Postcode must be |
|  | referred to IBAL Risk Management for review. |
|  | Exception and No Go postcodes will be determined by IBAL Risk Management and will be reviewed from time to time, with variations |
|  | to be notified accordinqly. |
|  | Secondary Postcodes represent all remaining postcodes. o |
|  | The Postcode Location list is located on the ING Intranet (Frankie) for IBAL users only. |
|  | Whilst IBAL lends across all postcodes care must be taken when assessing the suitability of a security property, particularly in |
|  | secondary postcode and/or where it does not meet the minimum valuation requirements. |
