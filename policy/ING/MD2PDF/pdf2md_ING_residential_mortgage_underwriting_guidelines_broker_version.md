## Eligible Borrowers

### Eligible Borrowers

#### ING

```
Acceptable
borrowers
```
```
Borrowers must be natural persons / individuals.
All borrowers must be an individual of at least 18 years of age (a minor is not permitted to be a borrower, guarantor or mortgagor).
Guarantors can be natural persons, companies or trusts.
```
```
All borrowers and guarantors must reside in Australia and be either an Australian citizen, permanent resident or New Zealand citizen.
```
```
For joint applications, it is acceptable if only one applicant is a permanent resident when both the applicants reside in Australia and are
married or in a de-facto relationship.
Unacceptable
borrowers
Loans to non-individual companies or trusts (company or individual as trustee) are unacceptable.
```
```
2.2. Mixed Parties
```
### Mixed Parties

```
Mixed parties are where borrowers have an interest in the primary security property, but not all parties have an interest in all security
properties.
For example: A and B are borrowers and mortgagors on Property 1 (loan/mortgage security/property). Only A are mortgagors on Property
2 (supporting security). There is no third party as all borrowers are mortgagors. The incomes of A and B must be included in servicing.
```
```
Third-party
security
```
```
Where borrowers rely on mortgage security provided by:
```
- Borrowers and a third-party or
- A third-party only,
The borrowers must pass servicing without any reliance on the third-party's income.
_For example: Mr Jones wants to be the only borrower to purchase an investment property, using an owner occupied home owned by both Mr
& his wife Mrs Jones._
In this case, the third-party (Mrs Jones) must be a guarantor and a recommendation must be made that the proposed guarantor obtain
independent legal advice and if required, financial advice. (see Section 2.7)
The guarantor (where third party security) must be a parent, child, de facto/spouse, company, Aunt or Uncle, or Parent-in-law of the
borrower.
An assessment of the financial strength and assets & liabilities of the third party guarantor must evidence that the guarantor will not
suffer substantial hardship if the security is called upon.


### Borrowers of convenience / Substantial Benefit

#### ING

**Borrowers of
convenience**

```
Borrowers of convenience are where borrowers income is insufficient, so an additional borrower is added to pass servicing.
For example: Borrowers A, B, and C apply for a loan for A and B to buy a property. C is a borrower of convenience and unacceptable,
unless where borrower C can establish a substantial benefit.
```
**Substantial
Benefit**

- All borrowers must have a substantial benefit in entering the loan.
Acceptable
A substantial benefit can be established where all borrowers:
- Each hold >=20% shareholding on title
OR
- Must be in a married or de facto relationship with each other and
    provide a satisfactory explanation for the structure (e.g. asset
    protection or taxation purposes)
OR
- Equal share when >=6 borrowers.

```
Unacceptable
```
- Borrowers of convenience are unacceptable when the co-
    borrower is not in a married or de facto relationship and
    derives little to no benefit from the transaction (less than
    20%).


```
2.4. Family Support
```
#### ING

### Family Support......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

```
Family Support allows a borrower/’s with a shortfall in savings (to meet LVR requirements), the ability to purchase or refinance property with
assistance of “Family member/’s” as guarantor Family member includes a spouse, de facto partner, child (including adopted or step child),
parent, grandparent, or sibling of an applicant.
This section applies to family member as Guarantee and mortgage for security support only. Refer procedure for IBAL’s requirements when
taking a guarantee.
Family members are also eligible as co-borrower/mortgagor (see standard credit policy).
```
```
Product
Availability
```
```
Family support is only available on a P & I basis.
```
```
Requirements
```
- Funding to a maximum of 100% of purchase price.
- Maximum 80% LVR and No LMI.
- Cash out or consolidation of debts is unacceptable (including credit cards/ other debts, or refinance of a partially
    constructed property).
- Family support is eligible for one borrower and one property. It is acceptable for guarantors to mortgage multiple
    properties.
- A financial assessment is required of the guarantor’s financial position both now and what could be reasonably expected in
    the future if the primary borrower were to default on the loan (This could take into account such issues as age, asset
    position and a “fall back” position for the guarantor should a default occur).

```
Additional
requirements
for Refinance
```
```
Refinance using family support requires:
```
- The existing loan structure with the current lender is under similar parameters (i.e. same borrowers, security and
    guarantors if any). A copy of the Letter of Offer or Loan Contract for the current facility must be provided for confirmation.
- Refinance of existing home loan only, with maximum additional funds to cover refinancing costs (up to $5,000). Any redraw
    with the existing lender, can be included in the refinance and is not classified as cash out.
- All guarantors must obtain new independent legal advice and if required, financial advice.


**Family
Support
continued**

```
Security
Support Only
```
```
Where security support by a family member, borrowers must be able to service the loan in their own right.
```
- IBAL’s preferred position is for the guarantee to equal all amounts owing under the loan plus other categories of liabilities
    such as interest and costs.
- Limited guarantees can be considered only where requested by customer/broker, provided the amount is sufficient for
    security support. Minimum amount of guarantee would be total loan amount less maximum security support (LVR) of
    primary security amount. Example: A Loan amount of $450,000, less $400,000 (80% of Property Value $500,000) equals
    $50,000 (Required amount of guarantee).

```
The maximum LVR where family member security support is 33% of the property value plus any other IBAL borrowings. (i.e.
Maximum loan amount is primary security @ 80% LVR plus support security @ 33% LVR.
```
```
2.5. Favourable purchases (Gift in equity)
```
**ING**

### Favourable purchases (Gift in equity)

```
A favourable purchase (Gift in equity) is where finance for a security property is being “purchased” at a lower price below market value.
This may occur in family situations where a parent sells a family property to a child to support the child’s entry into the property market. This
may also occur in a business relationship where a developer may sell a property to a business associate.
Favourable purchases requirement:
```
- Borrower’s must provide an ING Gift Statutory Declaration from the vendor stating that the equity in the property is being gifted and is not
    subject to being repaid at any time in the future by the child or person receiving the gift.

**Gifts**

```
Any gift that provides a borrower(s) with a deposit (equity to reduce LVR) or where known the purchase is a 100% gift requires a ING Gift
Statutory Declaration from the gift provider, stating that any monies/property are a non-refundable, non-repayable gift.
Note : The form must also contain any necessary Privacy Act requirements.
Where gift provider is overseas an equivalent Stat Dec/statement/letter or similar format can be used.
```
```
The assessment must consider the genuineness of any gift. Where any doubt, additional confirmation maybe required:
```
- a copy of a Bank account statement in the name of either the gift provider or the Applicant; clearly showing the amount of the gift;
- a Solicitor’s letter confirming the funds are held in their trust account.


### Mature Aged Applicants (Retirees)

#### ING

**Mature Aged**

```
Special consideration is required for applicants whose income capacity may finish or change before the end of the loan term.
This includes applicants over 50 years old with an end term date past 67 years old.
Owner occupied loans only.
An exit strategy and document verification may be required (at the time of approval) from either:
```
- Acceptable income cash flows if intend to work beyond retirement (as per income verification requirements)
- Cash savings (Savings history through bank statements)
- Payout from part of their superannuation (Superannuation/Annuities statements)
- Sale of investment assets e.g. shares/bonds/managed funds (shareholder statement or similar)
- Equity from sale of other real estate investment (evidence of property ownership)

```
2.7. Independent legal and financial advice
```
**ING**

### Independent legal and financial advice

```
Independent Legal and financial advice is required to be given by a lawyer / solicitor (legal advice), or an accountant or financial adviser
(financial advice) under certain circumstances.
```
```
IBAL recommends all guarantors obtain independent legal advice.
Guarantors are required to obtain independent legal advice where:
```
- Family Support (s2.5)
- Vulnerable and/or at risk of significant loss should the borrower default or
- Where Non-English speaking.
Non English Speaking Borrowers require extra care to ensure the borrower understands their contractual obligations. A translation
certificate is required (independent of the borrower) highlighting contracts and loan obligations.
A guarantor is not required to obtain independent legal advice where:
- a guarantor is in a profession such as lawyer/solicitor (legal advice) or an accountant or financial adviser (financial advice).
- a guarantor has previously obtained independent legal or financial advice for an IBAL guarantee
- a guarantor is a company director and has provided various guarantees to other funders for company liabilities
- if the guarantor is a company or trust owned by all the borrowers

**Financial
Advice**

```
Where the borrower or guarantor is elderly and/or in receipt of superannuation/annuities or government benefits (e.g. pension, family
allowance), it is recommended they obtain independent financial advice to ensure the transaction does not adversely impact their
entitlements (i.e. increased assets or income and the potential impact on means/asset testing).
```

### Funds to Complete / Genuine Savings

#### ING

**Funds to
Complete**

```
Evidence of sufficient funds to complete the property purchase (including costs) is required where >80% LVR (including capitalised
premium).
```
- Bank Statement, Letter from Solicitor, funds available in a line of credit, evidence of real estate sale price/existing debt.
Where <=80% LVR an assessment is made based on the financial position of applicants to ensure the customer has sufficient funds to
complete the property purchase (including costs).

**Genuine
Savings**

```
Evidence of 5% genuine savings is required where >90% LVR (including capitalised premium).
```
- Bank statements (transaction/savings/investment accounts) or share statement for >=3 months in the borrower’s name showing

       o Where <3 months: rental payments over >3 month period is acceptable verified by a Letter from a Real Estate or Bank Account
          Statement.
- Equity in an existing residential property (Ownership evidenced by a rates notice or via copy of title deed).
- May consider a gift / inheritance to make up the shortfall in savings, where savings have been sacrificed by making accelerated loan
    repayments (e.g. Personal Loans) over the last 3 months. In these circumstances, the existing savings plus the value of excess
    repayments must be equal to or greater than the minimum savings required. (IBAL is required to retain satisfactory evidence of savings
    and excess repayment verification on the loan file).
Unacceptable genuine savings:
- First Home Owners Grant

European Central Bank (ECB) Use Test Strategy analyses application data and customer behaviour on existing ING mortgage accounts.
Higher risk loans with an increased Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) require approval by an experienced staff
member.
These higher risk applications must be assessed by an experienced staff member to consider not approving any deviations/exceptions for
these deals and to take extra care where additional risks such as large amount of cash out (consider obtaining additional evidence or
controlling funds).

```
**Ban Period**
Individuals can request a Ban Period placed on their credit report, usually in cases of fraud.
The loan assessment can only occur once the ban period ends and a complete credit check report is received.


## Servicing and Income Verification

### Serviceability

#### ING

```
Minimum Net
Surplus
```
```
Loan serviceability calculations are based on post-tax income (subject to shadings).
Applications must pass loan serviceability assessment with a Minimum Net Surplus of greater than $1.
```
```
Post Tax Income – Total Commitments (including buffers, Living Expenses) = Net Surplus
```
```
Applicants must demonstrate by verified income they can service the loan or that the company borrower (if applicable) is a viable entity
with an ongoing ability to service the loan commitments.
Servicing is required in all cases. ING will not lend based only on the security LVR coverage for a loan.
All declared acceptable income must be verified. I.e. it is unacceptable to remove income where unable to verify or where the applicant be
unable to provide.
```
```
Debt to Income
(DTI)
```
```
DTI is all loans / sum of all gross eligible income (excluding shading).
A higher DTI ratio indicates a higher risk loan.
 DTI must be less than 8 where <=70% LVR.
```
```
 DTI must be less than 6 where >70% LVR.
```

```

there will be no voluntary superannuation deduction going forward).
```
```

verification
```
```
One of the following required:
```
- Rental statement
- Bank statement issued within the last month of application submission confirming receipt of rental income; or
- Current lease agreement
- Letter from licensed real estate agents. Additional mitigants required when only a letter and the gross rental yield used is > 6%.
- Tax Returns
- Panel Valuer’s estimates of the likely rental income (acceptable for purchases only).

```
Servicing must use the lower of evidenced or Valuer’s estimate.
```
```
When accepting evidenced rental income a common sense approach is applied to ensure that the rental returns are accepted at a
reasonable level.
Caution: where rental guarantees are involved or when the rental income appears high when compared to the value of the property. ING
need to ensure the income is sustainable, in line with the general market and not linked to a short term venture (e.g. mining, display
homes).
Rental income must not be the major source of income. Rental income must be limited to 50% of total income used in servicing (i.e. total
income used to pass servicing is $100,000; with $50,000 non-rental income and no more than $50,000 rental income).
```
```
When rent is derived from a share in an investment property then only the borrower’s share of rental income is allowed.
```

Rental Income from holiday homes, short term rentals is unacceptable

    - Last 2 years Financial Statements (including Profit & Loss Statement and Balance Sheet); OR
    - 2 years Company/Partnership/Trust tax returns.
**_and_**
- _Other Company/’s where director wages are not a source of income (directorships identified through bureau report), then_
    - _Most recent Company Financial Statement OR Tax Return OR an Accountant letter confirming company profitability._

```
Most recent year’s financials must be less than 19 months.
```
```
Financial Statements are not required for Publicly listed company’s or Partners in large law / accounting firms.
```
- In addition to above, high risk industry applicants require most recent 3 months BAS for the current financial year (where >$75k
    turnover).
High Risk industry includes:
- **Accommodation** - Hotels and similar accommodation, Holiday and other short-stay accommodation, Camping grounds, Recreational
    vehicle parks and trailer parks, Other accommodation
- **Air transport** - Passenger air transport, Freight air transport and space transport, Airport operations and other air transport support
    services
- **Food and beverage service activities** - Restaurants and mobile food service activities, Event catering activities, Other food service
    activities, Beverage serving activities
- **Gambling and betting activities;** and
- **Travel agency, tour operator and other reservation service and related activities**
Where suspicion of the integrity of the submitted tax returns, Credit assessors can request the latest ATO assessment notice (or if not
applicable, evidence of tax return lodgement).
- Validation required: the return was lodged and the taxable income aligns with the tax return.
In some cases interim financials maybe required.

```
Variance in
income
```
- Where <=20% variance over the last two years: it is acceptable to consider the most recent year’s income figure in servicing.
- Where decrease in income in most recent year the most recent year's income is used in servicing.
- In other cases the average income can be used in servicing.
**Note:** Where >20% variance in business/company income over the last 2 years an explanation of the cause(s) must be obtained and
retained on file to support the average of two years income used in the servicing.


```
Add-backs
```
```
Acceptable add-backs:
```
- Incomes/Salaries (not already included in calculation of personal gross incomes)
- Interest paid (as evidenced within the Profit and Loss Statement) can be used as an add-back where the associated debt repayments
    are included in the applicants servicing position (i.e. Include repayment/commitment on debts and allow add-back of interest on the
    same debts)
- Superannuation contributions in excess of statutory level
- Depreciation (where underpinning the replacement cost of an “essential asset that assists in the generation of business income”, an
    appropriate haircut may be considered on a case by case basis)
- Non-recurring expenses (explanation required from business/company accountant as to the nature of the expenses).
Unacceptable add-backs:
- Rentals paid for leased assets that the business/company does not own
- Revaluation of assets
- Research and Development.

```
Tax Return
```
- Ensure that all Tax File Numbers are removed from any documents.
- Tax agent or accountant prepared tax returns must show the following:
    o Tax agent reference number
    o Name and address of tax agent or Accountant
    o Accountant or tax agent disclaimer.

**Business/Comp
any
profitability**

```
In assessing business/company net profitability:
```
- When a business/company has made a loss there must be an appropriate adjustment to the servicing when using director’s personal
    income.
- Net profit includes only income received in the normal course of business.
- When assessing the profit before tax figure, the current company tax rate must be applied to derive the after-tax position.
- There must be no double counting, e.g. net profit is derived after deduction of Director/Consulting fees, salaries or other forms of
    remuneration paid to shareholders/partners/directors in the business.
- The net profit used for the assessment of loan serviceability should reflect a company’s true cashflow position, rather than purely an
    “accounting” profit in the context of accrual accounting.

```
Company
Profits
```
```
Variations ONLY
Where existing mortgage in name of Company or Trust borrower then Company Profits are also eligible.
Note : Add backs as above are acceptable for variations where a company borrower. When adding back “excess Superannuation”, “interest
paid on debts no longer current” and other “non-recurring expenses”, these are be added back as “Taxable Income” for the company in the
servicing spreadsheet.

```
Superannuation
(80%)
```
```
Payments must be ongoing and what is currently verified (not future payments).
A sufficient balance in superannuation funds must be held to ensure the payments are sustainable for the life of the loan (owner occupied

All existing commitments, liabilities, expenses and proposed loan commitments must be included into the servicing calculation.

 Any liabilities not included in servicing must have evidence at settlement on why not included (closed, reduced limit, or Letter of Offer ‘condition’ to be
closed)
**Existing financial commitments**

**Home Loans

- Calculated repayment amount on the loan commitment
The calculated repayment amount uses the higher of
- The floor assessment rate of 5.50%
or
- The interest rate by
    o For variable P&I loans the initial borrower rate
    o For variable interest only loans the equivalent P&I variable rate
    o For fixed P&I or fixed interest only loans either the equivalent P&I variable rate
       o OR the initial fixed borrower rate.
    o Plus a buffer of 3.00%.

```
The servicing calculation of repayments are assessed on a P&I repayments over the lower of remaining loan term or a maximum of 30
years. The term is reduced by any remaining interest only period.
Through the CCR data process, any undisclosed mortgage liability is assessed at an interest rate of 8%. Then once verified standard floors
and buffers above apply.
```
**Joint
Commitments**

```
Joint Commitments with co-applicants use 100% in servicing (i.e. joint and severally).
Joint commitments with non-applicants:
```
- At least 50% of the commitment must be used in servicing.
- Where 100% does not service then use 50% in servicing
    o If evidence the non-applicant can service the remaining 50% of repayments.
    o Or where unable to evidence then use 100% in servicing.
    o For existing IBAL & MM loans the original joint commitment assessment can be used when there is no reason to doubt this
       position has changed.


**Commercial
Loans**

```
The higher of
```
- Balance or
- Limit
Calculated with IBAL Assessment Rate using higher of
- The customer product rate plus a buffer of 1.5% or
- A ‘floor’ assessment rate of 7.5%
Using the above assessment rate, the servicing calculation of repayments vary by the repayment type of loan:
- Principal and Interest repayments: are assessed on P&I repayments over the lower of remaining loan term or a maximum loan term of
    20 years.
- Initial Interest only switching to principal and interest repayments: are assessed on P&I repayments over the lower of remaining loan
    term or a maximum loan term of 20 years, less any remaining interest only period.
- Interest only term with a balloon repayment: are assessed on P&I repayments over a 20 year loan term less remaining interest only
    period.

Unsecured Line
of Credits**
- Calculated repayment amount on the commitment
o Using 3% of the limit per month

**Buy Now Pay

- BNPL with an ongoing/revolving limit are treated like a credit card commitment.
- BNPL with a remaining term (i.e. instalment plan) are treated like a personal loan (with the BNPL outstanding balance and minimum
    monthly repayment captured).
- Where established the BNPL usage is short term and temporary in nature (closed prior to settlement), with confirmation from the
    borrower/’s (or the acting broker), the BNPL debt can be excluded from servicing.

Margin loan commitments can be excluded from the servicing where any investment income from the margin loan is not included in
servicing.
Where investment income from the margin loan is required for servicing and/or any concerns on the borrowers ability to service their
commitments, then:
```
- Include commitment of interest only repayment (using the Margin Loan limit calculated at the IBAL assessment rate) and
- Include any margin loan investment income.
Negative gearing benefits can be attributed to the Margin Loan limit, where required.

Additional further enquiry required when Declared Living Expenses 20% below benchmark
Declared Living Expenses must be reviewed for a reasonableness check. For example: the applicant declaring $10 per month for groceries
is not reasonable. In this instance the applicant may have misread the period (i.e. per week/month) or may have entered in error.
Additional checks include cross referencing with the characteristics of the applicant (e.g. single person living with parents) and any
supporting notes provided from Brokers that represent aspects of the applicants’ financial position.
Declared living expenses assessment may include reviewing bank statements (bankstatements.com or similar).
Any living expense updates (corrections or errors) must be made to the application prior to any final servicing assessment.
All mitigants/notes must be detailed within the application (e.g. applicant confirmed they declared $0 for transport as they receive a fully
maintain company car with transport costs evidenced through payslips or letter from employer).
```
```
If any supporting documents (e.g. Medicare Card, Tax Returns) are supplied as part of the loan application, the number of dependants
declared on the application form must be compared to any documents on file in relation to dependants (Medicare Card, Tax Returns or
Child Support document).

Two applicants (spousal or de facto relationship) $1,387 $ 320
Two applicants (spousal or de facto relationship) and dependant children $1,538 $ 355
```
```
Joint applicants not in a spousal or de facto relationship are each assessed separately as sole applicants (e.g. two times monthly rental
allowance used in servicing).
```
```
Where applicants declare they live “rent free” (or low rent), then a rental housing expense must be included in loan servicing.
```
- Rental housing expense can be excluded from servicing where evidence is obtained confirming it is a condition of employment. The
    living arrangement and confirmation that no rent (or low rent) is paid by the applicant must be evidenced by letter from employer or

**ING**

**Short Form
and
Full Form
Valuations**

```
Short form valuations are similar to an EVR, however the valuer completes a physical inspection of the property providing a more reliable
assessment of the property value.
Full Form valuations provide analysis of supporting information and a high level of detail.
```
- Full Form Valuations are generally obtained where limited sales comparisons (e.g. for unique or high end properties) and/or where
    additional investigation required.
A Short Form or Full Form valuation is required when
- not covered by valuation method above OR
- In all cases where >80% LVR.
A short form or full valuation is required for:
- Off the plan purchases.
- Brand new properties or properties under construction.
- Property purchased direct from a builder/developer.
- If a “favourable purchase” or “not at arm’s length purchase”, then the valuer needs to be instructed this is the case.
    o A favourable purchase (Gift in equity) is where finance for a security property is being “purchased” at a lower price below
       market value.
- Mortgage Manager Business.
*Full Form valuations are required where the single property value is greater than $5.0m
- Properties are valued on their state at the time of inspection, with an "as is" valuation report provided.
Where an “as if complete” valuation report is provided the assessor must comment as to the acceptability of the report e.g. minor finishes
including flooring & appliances, or common property in the development is to be completed. For increases for Non – Structural

```
**Variations
between
Purchase Price
and Valuation**

```
Any variation >10% between the purchase price and the valuation (e.g. as a result of two tier marketing, or related party purchases)
requires a detailed assessment.
Where the valuation amount is less than the purchase price of the subject property by 10% or more, the borrower needs to be promptly
informed and given the option to either proceed or withdraw the loan application and the opportunity to seek independent advice before
accepting IBAL loan offer.
Variations of this nature could be the result of “two tier marketing”, which is the practise of having two prices or tiers in a real estate
market, one for locals who know the market values in the area, and one price for other buyers, often from interstate or overseas, who are
not aware of local market prices.
Where a valuation indicates two tier marketing techniques may be in use, additional care is to be taken to ensure the current market value
is used in calculating the applicable LVR.
Clause to be inserted in the loan approval and as a special condition in the letter of offer.
“You acknowledge that the property at [address] has been valued at significantly less than the purchase price which we understand is $xxx,xxx. This
valuation is for our internal use, and you are not entitled to rely on it. In the light of this information, we strongly recommend that you make independent
enquiries as to the value of the property. It is common for valuers to value slightly below purchase price, and of course, the assessment by our valuer may
have been unusually conservative or based on incomplete information. This underlines the importance of you making your own enquiries. By proceeding to
drawdown the loan, you acknowledge you are aware of this issue and wish to borrow the loan despite this fact.”
```
**Second Opinion
Valuation**

```
Second opinion valuations are not permitted. It is unacceptable for a valuation request be withdrawn from a valuer on the basis that the valuer’s
valuation amount is not to the expectation of an introducer/originator.
An introducer or mortgage manager can seek a valuation reassessed with legitimate reasons  see valuation appeals procedure for further assessment.
```
**Valuation age**

```
For new business applications only (not including variations or increases):
```
- Valuations must be dated less than 90 days old as at time of assessment.
- Valuations must be dated less than 6 months old as at time of settlement.


**6. Variations**
    **6.1. Variations
ING
Eligible
borrowers**

```
Further to eligible borrowers, Variations to existing borrowings using existing security are acceptable for loans to non-individuals (e.g. trusts
and companies) Increases and variations to existing mortgage loan accounts in the name of a trust or company borrower are acceptable.
Income
Verification
```
```
Where Income verification is required for variations see s3 above.
Where existing mortgage in name of Company or Trust borrower then Company Profits are also eligible.
```
```
Full Discharges
The release of IBAL security must be approved by an authorised person and requires confirmation that sufficient funds are to be received
to clear all loans secured by that security.
```
```
Partial
Discharge
```
```
Partial discharges can be approved provided the residual debt is within the approving staff member limit.
Servicing
Serviceability is not required where LVR remains the same or decreases and is within product parameters.
Note : Assessment of servicing can be considered where:
```
- Full sale proceeds are not obtained.
- Property being released is deriving rental return.
- Doubt exists as to the validity of the transaction (E.g. non arm’s length sales, sales not involving a Real
    Estate Agent).
- Where arrears history is evident (greater than 1 payment in arrears (greater than 30 days) in the last 6
    months) or where there is evidence that the customer has been in hardship in the previous 12 months
    (Care to be taken to ensure borrowers are financially stable).
**Valuations**
Non LMI Loans
Re-valuation on remaining security is required where:
- LVR increases and is outside product parameters or;
- We are not obtaining full net sale proceeds; or
- Doubt exists as to the validity of the transaction (E.g. non arm’s length sales, sales not involving a Real Estate Agent).
LMI Loans
Valuation required on remaining security and LVR must remain within product parameters.


**Substitution of
Security**

```
Full assessment is not required if:
```
- No increase in LVR (normal valuation requirements to apply)
- No significant change in locality
- No change of employer for applicant
- No change in sources of income that were used in last approval .i.e. change or removal of investment property income
- New security meets normal policy.
A Full Assessment is to be considered where new security property is not in a primary postcode.

**Switches**

```
It is important to consider whether the proposed switch will impact or change a borrower’s repayment arrangement. Therefore, in some
circumstances it is appropriate that we confirm a borrower’s ability to maintain P&I payments on an ongoing basis.
```
- Switching between product types do not require a servicing assessment:
    - Orange Advantage to Mortgage Simplifier.
    - Mortgages Simplifier to Orange Advantage.
    - Mortgage Simplifier/ Orange Advantage, from variable rate to a fixed Rate.
    - Interest only to principle & interest repayments.
- Switches to interest only require a servicing assessment in all cases as per standard policy and maximum LVR 80% (including
    investment):
    - Requests for interest only repayments.
    - Extension of interest only repayments.
- Switches from obsolete products require a full application and servicing assessment as per standard policy.


**Increases**

```
This underwriting guideline is to apply in circumstances where an existing customer requests an increase or new facility to any existing
facility (including REP loans).
Increases to existing low doc loans can only be considered on a full financial disclosed basis (i.e. new financial and servicing assessment
required).
The following conditions must be satisfied:
General
```
- A signed application form must be received from all borrowers/guarantors.
- The new loan amount must continue to meet IBAL serviceability requirements (Section 3 ).
- Income/employment are verified as per Section 3 above.
- Security property remains within maximum Security LVR.
- Maximum LVR (including any capitalised LMI premium) to apply to increases are as follows (with no deviations permitted)
    - Maximum 90% for simple home improvements where an “as is” valuation is relied upon
    - 80% against owner occupied or investment securities for equity release, cash out, refinance and debt consolidation.
- For loan increase of more than $50,000, a new title search is to be performed and is to reveal no subsequent interests noted on the
    title.
**Valuations**
Refer to **Section 5**.
**Account Conduct**
Refer to Unacceptable and Adverse Credit History in Section 2.9
**Credit Checks (Veda Advantage)**
A Credit Check Report is mandatory.


**Non-Structural
Improvements**

```
With no option to provide construction loans with progress payments, home improvements for increases >80% LVR can still be considered
but must be for "non-structural" purposes (e.g. Kitchen / Bathroom upgrades etc).
The additional requirements are:
```
- Maximum amount $50,000
- Maximum LVR 90% (no deviations allowed)
- Single drawdown (but possibly multiple cheques)
- Should borrower want separate drawdowns to accommodate various works being undertaken then separate increase requests may
    need to be considered.
**Depending on the situation, there are two options available when obtaining a valuation:**
    **1. ‘As Is’ Valuation**
- Reliance is on a current valuation prior to the proposed non-structural improvements (as is value).
- Supporting evidence (e.g. invoice or quotes) must be provided to confirm that funds will be used for property improvements
    **2. ‘As if complete’ Valuation**
- Upfront valuation with specific quotes/contract/tender to be provided and commented on by valuer in the valuation report.
On settlement bank cheques are to be made payable in accordance with the specific quotes/contracts/tenders used in completing the
valuation report and provided to the borrower who is then responsible for control of payment to contractor on completion of works.
**Increase in
Conjunction
with Other
Variations**

```
Any request which includes an increase and other variation must satisfy the above eligibility criteria in conjunction with the requirements
associated with the other variation (e.g. a substitution and increase request must satisfy both the requirements of the substitution and the
increase).
```
**Consent to a
Second
Mortgage**

```
Appropriately authorised person can approve consents to second mortgages to other lenders and plans of sub-division or strata title of the
Bank’s security for loans/exposures.
Consent by IBAL to a second mortgage by another financier/lender is permissible subject to obtaining the same approval as is required for
an amended transaction.
Considerations in consenting to a second^ mortgage are:
```
- Must be in an open form without restriction to IBAL first mortgage
- Impact of second mortgage on existing facility
- If requested to restrict IBAL first mortgage, care must be taken to ensure that the value of the security will not be eroded
- Retain priority for a minimum of principal and interest and interest outstanding at any time plus any recovery costs (including legal
    fees, disbursements and costs that may be incurred in the sale of any security).
Refer to panel solicitors for the preparation of the priority agreement.

**Other Consents**

```
Consents to sub-divisions, strata plans, etc. must have been signed off by the IBAL’s solicitors as being in order for registration.
Due consideration needs to be given to obtaining a new valuation(s), in particular for sub-divisions and new strata plans, to ensure that
after the transaction is complete the bank’s security is not eroded and ensure it remains within normal underwriting guidelines.
```

**Consent
Processing by
Non-DLA
Holders**

```
The following, specific, consent requests to produce a security title can be processed by the “Maintenance Processing Team – Mortgage
Operations” without reference to a DLA holder, subject to a 4 eye check and full compliance with the approved Processing Procedure as
well as reference to sections above:
```
- Register 2nd Mortgages (including purpose of Register 2nd Mortgage for Bail Surety).
- De-Register 2nd Mortgage
- Subdivision of security (with no partial discharge request attached)
- Acquisition of underground land. If any change to land size (i.e. involves acquisition of actual land) a valuation is required and it must
    be referred to a DLA holder for sign-off.
- Production of title with no impact to the property– e.g.: Easement
All other consent requests must be referred to an appropriate DLA holder for review and acceptance.

**Deed of Charge**

```
IBAL’s preferred security is freehold property however, cash collateral (held with ING) is accepted in short term scenario’s when:
```
- An existing borrower is to substitute security property, but the current security property is to be released prior to the new security
    being perfected. IBAL will hold settlement proceeds as the security for the loan (at a maximum LVR of 100%) until the new security
    property is settled.
The cash is to be lodged in a suitable IBAL deposit account (to be “Stopped”), with the necessary security documents (including Deed of
Charge and Setoff) prepared by IBAL Panel Solicitors.

```
Deed of Charge and Setoff over cash deposit capped at 100% LVR
```

**Reduced Equity
Product (REP)
Loans**

```
While this product has been removed from sale, the following variations and/or increases for existing accounts can still be approved under
these guidelines (subject to current LVR restrictions).
Acceptable
```
- Increase of existing loans for non-structural home improvements (Refer note below).
- Substitution of security with no change to borrowers and no increase.
- Substitution of security with an increase; not above the original REP Loan amount.
- Variations/ increases of REP loans that satisfy normal policy and result in a maximum LVR of 80%.
**Unacceptable** (require a new full loan approval under LMI)
- Add an additional borrower.
- Removal of borrower.
- Substitution of security with an increase; above the original REP Loan amount.
    **Note** : Increases to existing REP loans can only be considered for home improvements
    where there is no reliance on the on-completion valuation and satisfactory evidence of
    the purpose of funds are held on file.
In addition to the normal requirements of a variation, (e.g. increase), applications involving existing REP Loans must also satisfy the below
requirements with no deviations allowed:
    - The maximum loan amount for REP is $600,000 plus any capitalised fee.
    - REP loans must be on a principal and interest basis and capped at 90% (including capitalised fee).
    - Debt consolidation and cash out (equity release) is not allowed.
    - Maximum LVR is 90% for substitutions including any capitalised fee.
    - No evidence of adverse credit, as defined under Section 2.9
    - No third party security, except where debtors are spouse /de-facto (only) and the mortgagor is one of the debtors.
    - No second mortgages permitted.
    - Any cross collateralisation of any existing securities held by IBAL is not permitted with any new approval under this policy.
**Acceptable Security**
- Postcode Categories 1, 2 and Exception.

**8. Appendix**

```
Postcode categories
```
```
IBAL will consider lending for residential products in any Australian postcode.
The acceptable postcode list includes
o Primary Postcodes with a sub section for both Exception and No Go Postcodes.
```
```
Primary Postcodes are classified as Category 1, 2 and 3 to rank regional areas and used to identify restrictions for loans with LMI
approved under DUA.
The exception postcodes cover where lending restrictions are imposed on units/apartments within that postcode for a particular
reason e.g. inner city/core or fringe CBD apartments, areas where oversupply exists, areas affected by disasters etc. For this reason,
they must undergo greater scrutiny at assessment and with a heightened level of review on the valuation.
No Go postcodes are locations where IBAL Risk Management have identified areas of concern over the location and may wish to
prevent any increased exposure to the location. Any new or increased loans secured by properties in a No Go Postcode must be
referred to IBAL Risk Management for review.
Exception and No Go postcodes will be determined by IBAL Risk Management and will be reviewed from time to time, with variations
to be notified accordingly.
o Secondary Postcodes represent all remaining postcodes.
```
```
The Postcode Location list is located on the ING Intranet (Frankie) for IBAL users only.
Whilst IBAL lends across all postcodes care must be taken when assessing the suitability of a security property, particularly in
secondary postcode and/or where it does not meet the minimum valuation requirements.
