      <p>Up to maximum 80% LVR</p>
      <p>An EVR or Desktop Valuation is where the valuer gives a valuation by using local knowledge and statistical data (without physically inspecting the property). The EVR includes Property and Market Risk Ratings and sales comparison analysis ('like properties' and 'properties sold'). The valuer may speak with the owner or real estate agent to confirm the number of bedrooms and condition of the property etc.</p>
