      <ul>
        <li>Caution where rental guarantees are involved or when the rental income appears high when compared to the value of the property.</li>
        <li>ING need to ensure the income is sustainable, in line with the general market and not linked to a short term venture (e.g. mining, display homes).</li>
        <li>Rental income must not be the major source of income. Rental income must be limited to 50% of total income used in servicing.</li>
