      <p>Mixed parties are where borrowers have an interest in the primary security property, but not all parties have an interest in all security properties.</p>
      <p>For example: A and B are borrowers and mortgagors on Property 1 (loan/mortgage security/property). Only A are mortgagors on Property 2 (supporting security). There is no third party as all borrowers are mortgagors. The incomes of A and B must be included in servicing.</p>

    <td>Third-party security</td>
    <td>
      <p>Where borrowers rely on mortgage security provided by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Borrowers and a third-party or</li>
        <li>A third-party only,</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The borrowers must pass servicing without any reliance on the third-party's income.</p>
      <p>For example: Mr Jones wants to be the only borrower to purchase an investment property, using an owner occupied home owned by both Mr & his wife Mrs Jones.</p>
      <p>In this case, the third-party (Mrs Jones) must be a guarantor and a recommendation must be made that the proposed guarantor obtain independent legal advice and if required, financial advice. (see Section 2.7)</p>
      <p>The guarantor (where third party security) must be a parent, child, de facto/spouse, company, Aunt or Uncle, or Parent-in-law of the borrower.</p>
      <p>An assessment of the financial strength and assets & liabilities of the third party guarantor must evidence that the guarantor will not suffer substantial hardship if the security is called upon.</p>
