        <li>Property being released is deriving rental return.</li>
        <li>Doubt exists as to the validity of the transaction (E.g. non arm's length sales, sales not involving a Real Estate Agent).</li>
        <li>Where arrears history is evident (greater than 1 payment in arrears (greater than 30 days) in the last 6 months) or where there is evidence that the customer has been in hardship in the previous 12 months (Care to be taken to ensure borrowers are financially stable).</li>

    <td>Switches</td>
    <td>
      <p>It is important to consider whether the proposed switch will impact or change a borrower's repayment arrangement. Therefore, in some circumstances it is appropriate that we confirm a borrower's ability to maintain P&I payments on an ongoing basis.</p>
