    <th>Postcode categories</th>
    <td>
      <p>IBAL will consider lending for residential products in any Australian postcode.</p>
      <p>The acceptable postcode list includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary Postcodes with a sub section for both Exception and No Go Postcodes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Primary Postcodes are classified as Category 1, 2 and 3 to rank regional areas and used to identify restrictions for loans with LMI approved under DUA.</p>
      <p>The exception postcodes cover where lending restrictions are imposed on units/apartments within that postcode for a particular reason e.g. inner city/core or fringe CBD apartments, areas where oversupply exists, areas affected by disasters etc. For this reason, they must undergo greater scrutiny at assessment and with a heightened level of review on the valuation.</p>
      <p>No Go postcodes are locations where IBAL Risk Management have identified areas of concern over the location and may wish to prevent any increased exposure to the location. Any new or increased loans secured by properties in a No Go Postcode must be referred to IBAL Risk Management for review.</p>
      <p>Exception and No Go postcodes will be determined by IBAL Risk Management and will be reviewed from time to time, with variations to be notified accordingly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Secondary Postcodes represent all remaining postcodes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Postcode Location list is located on the ING Intranet (Frankie) for IBAL users only.</p>
      <p>Whilst IBAL lends across all postcodes care must be taken when assessing the suitability of a security property, particularly in secondary postcode and/or where it does not meet the minimum valuation requirements.</p>
