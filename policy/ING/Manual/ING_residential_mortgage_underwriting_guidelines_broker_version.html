        For example: A and B are borrowers and mortgagors on Property 1 (loan/mortgage security/property). Only A are mortgagors on Property 2 (supporting security). There is no third party as all borrowers are mortgagors. The incomes of A and B must be included in servicing.</td>

        For example: Mr Jones wants to be the only borrower to purchase an investment property, using an owner occupied home owned by both Mr &amp; his wife Mrs Jones.<br/><br/>
        In this case, the third-party (Mrs Jones) must be a guarantor and a recommendation must be made that the proposed guarantor obtain independent legal advice and if required, financial advice. (see Section 2.7)<br/><br/>
        The guarantor (where third party security) must be a parent, child, de facto/spouse, company, Aunt or Uncle, or Parent-in-law of the borrower.<br/><br/>
        An assessment of the financial strength and assets &amp; liabilities of the third party guarantor must evidence that the guarantor will not suffer substantial hardship if the security is called upon.</td>

It is common for valuers to value slightly below purchase price, and of course, the assessment by our valuer may have been unusually conservative or based on incomplete information.

                With no option to provide construction loans with progress payments, home improvements for increases &gt;80% LVR can still be considered but must be for "non-structural" purposes (e.g. Kitchen / Bathroom upgrades etc).
                <p>The additional requirements are:</p>
<div class="bullet-point">
                    • Maximum amount $50,000<br/>
                    • Maximum LVR 90% (no deviations allowed)<br/>
                    • Single drawdown (but possibly multiple cheques)<br/>
                    • Should borrower want separate drawdowns to accommodate various works being undertaken then separate increase requests may need to be considered.
                </div>
<p>Depending on the situation, there are two options available when obtaining a valuation:</p>
<p>1. 'As Is' Valuation</p>
<div class="bullet-point">
                    • Reliance is on a current valuation prior to the proposed non-structural improvements (as is value).<br/>
                    • Supporting evidence (e.g. invoice or quotes) must be provided to confirm that funds will be used for property improvements
                </div>
<p>2. 'As if complete' Valuation</p>
<div class="bullet-point">
                    • Upfront valuation with specific quotes/contract/tender to be provided and commented on by valuer in the valuation report.
                </div>
<p>On settlement bank cheques are to be made payable in accordance with the specific quotes/contracts/tenders used in completing the valuation report and provided to the borrower who is then responsible for control of payment to contractor on completion of works.</p>

<li>Retain priority for a minimum of principal and interest and interest outstanding at any time plus any recovery costs (including legal fees, disbursements and costs that may be incurred in the sale of any security).</li>

<td style="width: 20%;">Postcode categories</td>
<td>
<p>IBAL will consider lending for residential products in any Australian postcode.</p>
<p>The acceptable postcode list includes</p>
<p>o Primary Postcodes with a sub section for both Exception and No Go Postcodes.</p>
<p>Primary Postcodes are classified as Category 1, 2 and 3 to rank regional areas and used to identify restrictions for loans with LMI approved under DUA.</p>
<p>The exception postcodes cover where lending restrictions are imposed on units/apartments within that postcode for a particular reason e.g. inner city/core or fringe CBD apartments, areas where oversupply exists, areas affected by disasters etc. For this reason, they must undergo greater scrutiny at assessment and with a heightened level of review on the valuation.</p>
<p>No Go postcodes are locations where IBAL Risk Management have identified areas of concern over the location and may wish to prevent any increased exposure to the location. Any new or increased loans secured by properties in a No Go Postcode must be referred to IBAL Risk Management for review.</p>
<p>Exception and No Go postcodes will be determined by IBAL Risk Management and will be reviewed from time to time, with variations to be notified accordingly.</p>
<p>o Secondary Postcodes represent all remaining postcodes.</p>
<p>The Postcode Location list is located on the ING Intranet (Frankie) for IBAL users only.</p>
<p>Whilst IBAL lends across all postcodes care must be taken when assessing the suitability of a security property, particularly in secondary postcode and/or where it does not meet the minimum valuation requirements.</p>
