<h3>Off-the-Plan Purchase</h3>

                Updated financials may be required for re-assessment of any approval where completion/settlement does not occur within the timeframe allowable under the approval i.e. greater than 3 months. The front and special conditions pages (at a minimum) of the Contract of Sale are to be perused by the approving officer to ensure there are no rebates/incentives involved in the purchase. If there are, then the Valuer will need to be advised accordingly, and adjustments may need to be made to the security value.<br/><br/>
                Valuations can disregard the value of rental guarantees, furniture or any other incentives that have been included in the purchase.<br/><br/>
<strong>Off-The-Plan Contract was signed over 12 months ago</strong><br/>
                Where the value of the property has increased during the construction period IBAL will consider lending against a maximum 100% of the agreed purchase price, noting the loan must not exceed standard security LVR parameters based on the higher current valuation.<br/><br/>
<strong>Validity of Valuations</strong><br/>
                Valuations must be conducted at practical completion of such projects with settlements expected no later than 3 months from valuations.<br/><br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> Valuers are required to include comparable sales outside the subject properties – must not principally rely on sales within the subject properties.

<td>Variations between Purchase Price and Valuation</td>
<td colspan="3">
            Any variation &gt;10% between the purchase price and the valuation (e.g. as a result of two tier marketing, or related party purchases) requires a detailed assessment.<br/><br/>
            Where the valuation amount is less than the purchase price of the subject property by 10% or more, the borrower needs to be promptly informed and given the option to either proceed or withdraw the loan application and the opportunity to seek independent advice before accepting IBAL loan offer.<br/><br/>
            Variations of this nature could be the result of "two tier marketing", which is the practise of having two prices or tiers in a real estate market, one for locals who know the market values in the area, and one price for other buyers, often from interstate or overseas, who are not aware of local market prices.<br/><br/>
            Where a valuation indicates two tier marketing techniques may be in use, additional care is to be taken to ensure the current market value is used in calculating the applicable LVR.<br/><br/>
<strong>Clause to be inserted in the loan approval and as a special condition in the letter of offer:</strong><br/>
<span class="italic">"You acknowledge that the property at [address] has been valued at significantly less than the purchase price which we understand is $xxx,xxx. This valuation is for our internal use, and you are not entitled to rely on it. In the light of this information, we strongly recommend that you make independent enquiries as to the value of the property. It is common for valuers to value slightly below purchase price, and of course, the assessment by our valuer may have been unusually conservative or based on incomplete information. This underlines the importance of you making your own enquiries. By proceeding to drawdown the loan, you acknowledge you are aware of this issue and wish to borrow the loan despite this fact."</span>

            Second opinion valuations are not permitted. It is unacceptable for a valuation request be withdrawn from a valuer on the basis that the valuer's valuation amount is not to the expectation of an introducer/originator.<br/><br/>
            An introducer or mortgage manager can seek a valuation reassessed with legitimate reasons → see valuation appeals procedure for further assessment.

<li>The new loan amount must continue to meet IBAL serviceability requirements (Section 3).</li>
<li>Income/employment are verified as per Section 3 above.</li>
<li>Security property remains within maximum Security LVR.</li>
<li>Maximum LVR (including any capitalised LMI premium) to apply to increases are as follows (with no deviations permitted)
                <ul class="nested-ul">
<li>Maximum 90% for simple home improvements where an "as is" valuation is relied upon</li>
<li>80% against owner occupied or investment securities for equity release, cash out, refinance and debt consolidation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For loan increase of more than $50,000, a new title search is to be performed and is to reveal no subsequent interests noted on the title.</li>

                With no option to provide construction loans with progress payments, home improvements for increases &gt;80% LVR can still be considered but must be for "non-structural" purposes (e.g. Kitchen / Bathroom upgrades etc).
                <p>The additional requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum amount $50,000</li>
<li>Maximum LVR 90% (no deviations allowed)</li>
<li>Single drawdown (but possibly multiple cheques)</li>
<li>Should borrower want separate drawdowns to accommodate various works being undertaken then separate increase requests may need to be considered.</li>

<p>Depending on the situation, there are two options available when obtaining a valuation:</p>
<p>1. 'As Is' Valuation</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliance is on a current valuation prior to the proposed non-structural improvements (as is value).</li>
<li>Supporting evidence (e.g. invoice or quotes) must be provided to confirm that funds will be used for property improvements</li>

<p>2. 'As if complete' Valuation</p>
<ul>
<li>Upfront valuation with specific quotes/contract/tender to be provided and commented on by valuer in the valuation report.</li>

                IBAL will consider lending for residential products in any Australian postcode.<br/><br/>
                The acceptable postcode list includes<br/>
                o Primary Postcodes with a sub section for both Exception and No Go Postcodes.<br/><br/>
                
                Primary Postcodes are classified as Category 1, 2 and 3 to rank regional areas and used to identify restrictions for loans with LMI approved under DUA.<br/><br/>
                
                The exception postcodes cover where lending restrictions are imposed on units/apartments within that postcode for a particular reason e.g. inner city/core or fringe CBD apartments, areas where oversupply exists, areas affected by disasters etc. For this reason, they must undergo greater scrutiny at assessment and with a heightened level of review on the valuation.<br/><br/>
                
                No Go postcodes are locations where IBAL Risk Management have identified areas of concern over the location and may wish to prevent any increased exposure to the location. Any new or increased loans secured by properties in a No Go Postcode must be referred to IBAL Risk Management for review.<br/><br/>
                
                Exception and No Go postcodes will be determined by IBAL Risk Management and will be reviewed from time to time, with variations to be notified accordingly.<br/><br/>
                
                o Secondary Postcodes represent all remaining postcodes.<br/><br/>
                
                The Postcode Location list is located on the ING Intranet (Frankie) for IBAL users only.<br/><br/>
                
                Whilst IBAL lends across all postcodes care must be taken when assessing the suitability of a security property, particularly in secondary postcode and/or where it does not meet the minimum valuation requirements.
