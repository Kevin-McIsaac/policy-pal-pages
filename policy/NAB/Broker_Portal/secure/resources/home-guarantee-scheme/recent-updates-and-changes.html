<h2>
<strong>01 September 2024 - Home Guarantee Scheme – FY25 Required Documents Update</strong>
</h2>
<p>FY24 ATO Notice of Assessment estimates will no longer be accepted from 1 September 2024. Please ensure you have obtained your customer’s FY24 (ending 30 June 2024) ATO Notice of Assessment (NOA) or evidence of non-lodgement and attach to your customer’s application prior to submission.</p>
<p>
<strong>Important: </strong>If customer does not have a valid FY24 NOA due to the following reasons:
    </p>
<ol>
<li>Applicant(s) do not have a TFN; OR</li>
<li>Applicant(s) were previously working overseas and obtained a TFN on/after 1 July 2024 and thus are not able to obtain an FY24 NOA</li>
</ol>
<p>
        Please contact the HGS team on <a href="mailto:hgsbrokersupport@nab.com.au">hgsbrokersupport@nab.com.au</a> to discuss alternative forms of income cap evidence.

<strong>1 July 2024 - NOW LIVE Home Guarantee Scheme – FY25</strong>
<br/>
</h2>
<p>NAB is pleased to continue helping customers into their first home with the new release of Home Guarantee Scheme (HGS) FY25 Scheme places.</p>
<p>
<strong>FY25 Scheme Places (From 01 July 2024):</strong>
</p>
<p>
        NAB has uplifted evidence requirements for FY25 to ensure conformance to HGS Scheme Rules. <strong>These changes include:</strong>
</p>
</root>
</div>
<div class="text">
<root>
<p>
<strong>Australian Passports:</strong> Must be current and valid if being utilised to evidence Australian Citizenship.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Permanent Residency (NZ Citizens):</strong> New Zealand Citizens who hold a Special Category Visa (SCV) 444 are considered to be an ‘Australian Permanent Resident’ and therefore eligible for the scheme.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>All Citizenship/Age documentation:</strong> Must be certified true copies and can be attested via:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Sighting the documents in person and provide an attestation in the applications notes; OR
            <br/>
</li>
<li>Include these documents as part of the IDYou process (VOI); OR</li>
<li>Provide photocopies which are certified by an authorised person.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Genuine Savings:</strong> Ensure post-settlement customer savings are comprehensively explained, especially if post-settlement savings are greater than $30,000. If customers have savings of 20% or more evidenced, they are not eligible for the schemes.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Post-Settlement Address:</strong>
</p>
<p>HGS rules state that customers must move into the property within the timeframe set out by Housing Australia.</p>
<p>Customers must update their address once they have purchased their property, by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirming it as the post-settlement address in the lending application; or</li>
<li>Letting NAB know once they’ve moved in</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:  For existing purchases, the customer(s) must move in within 6 months.</p>
<p>For construction purchases, the customer(s) must move in once an occupancy certificate is issued. </p>
<p>
<strong>Ongoing Scheme Eligibility:</strong> Customers must also be reminded that the HGS secured property must not be rented out as per the conditions of the scheme otherwise the Government Guarantee will be void, meaning they will be liable for any shortfall should they find themselves in a default position.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>What’s next?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Evidencing income eligibility for FY25 Scheme Places:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>FY24 ATO Notice of Assessment (NOA)</strong>
</p>
<p>With new FY25 Scheme places released on 1 July 2024, we know applicants may not have completed their FY24 tax return before applying.</p>
<p>
        To ensure they can still apply, between <strong>1 July 2024</strong> and <strong>31 August 2024</strong> you can provide an estimate of their income eligibility in the comments section of the application to achieve <strong>conditional approval</strong>.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Your customer should lodge their FY24 tax return as soon possible</strong> as their FY24 ATO NOA must be provided before unconditional approval can be given.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Note: </strong>After 31 August 2024 the process will revert to normal and requires a FY24 ATO NOA to evidence their income eligibility before conditional approval can be issued.
        <br/>
</p>
<p>Start conversations with your customers about how you can help them buy their new home sooner with only a 5% deposit for the First Home Guarantee, Regional First Home Buyers Guarantee or 2% deposit for the Family Home Guarantee with no Lenders Mortgage Insurance. When ready, submit their applications so they have the best chance of securing a new Scheme place.</p>

<strong>18 June 2024 - Home Guarantee Scheme – FY25 Refresh</strong>
<br/>
</h2>
<p>NAB is pleased to continue helping customers into their first home with the next release of Home Guarantee Scheme (HGS or Scheme) places on 1 July 2024.</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE: FY24 scheme places</strong> are still available through NAB. The process and evidence requirements for current <strong>FY24 places</strong> remains the same and are listed on the NAB Broker Portal.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>FY24 Scheme Places Ending on 30 June 2024:  </strong>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
        FY24 Scheme places under the <strong>FY24 eligibility criteria will be ending</strong> as of 30 June 2024. If you are wanting to reserve your customer under an FY24 scheme place, it is vital you lodge an application by 27 June 2024 so we can look to proactively reserve your customer even if the application hasn’t been assessed yet.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please ensure that the customer(s) Medicare details have been attached to the application so we can look to proactively reserve your customers onto the FY24 scheme. If the Medicare details aren’t provided, we will not be able to reserve your customers onto the scheme since it is a required field on the HGS portal.
    </p>
<p>
        The HGS portal will not allow lenders to reserve an FY24 scheme places on or after 1 July 2024 and any places reserved from 1 July 2024 onwards will be an FY25 scheme place, which will require an FY24 NOA for unconditional approval.
        <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>FY25 Scheme Places starting on 01 July 2024:</strong>
<br/>

<h2>
        20 November 2023 – Uplifting of Maximum Deposit Utilised and Retained Savings Policy
        <br/>
</h2>
<p>As part of NAB’s commitment to upholding the intent and integrity of the Home Guarantee schemes, we will be requiring brokers to confirm that customers are utilising their maximum deposit for the HGS schemes in the form of a note and to provide an explanation as to the purpose of any retained savings after utilising their maximum deposit when applying under the Home Guarantee Schemes.</p>
<p>Under Section 29K of Housing Australia’s Investment Mandate (IM), one of the key principles for the operation of the Home Guarantee Schemes is to:</p>
<p>“ensure that eligible home buyers have used the maximum amount of savings as a deposit, subject to the credit policies of eligible lenders”</p>
<p>This means that customers applying for a Home Guarantee Scheme must use their maximum deposit available and not look to minimise their deposit amount when purchasing a new property for the purpose of maximising LVR and the Government Guarantee.</p>
<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> If customers have a 20% deposit or more evidenced in their accounts/statements or lending application then they are not eligible for the schemes.
    </p>
<p>As such, where customers have total savings which amount to less than 20% of the Property Purchase Price and are planning to retain some savings for purchase-related costs such as moving costs, furniture and/or other personal reasons, please ensure this is documented in your application and provide specific reasoning as to why they are retaining certain savings -</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer(s) have utilised their maximum deposit for the HGS schemes and any retained savings is to be used for (state reasons)</li>
</ul>

<h2>01 November 2023 – NHFIC becomes Housing Australia– FY24 Housing Australia</h2>
<p>
        From October 12, 2023, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC) has rebranded to “Housing Australia”. As such, content and collaterals referencing NHFIC have been updated to Housing Australia.
        <br/>
<br/>
        There will be no changes to existing process around assisting customers onto the Home Guarantee Schemes.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> Please ensure that you are using the new relevant documents and resources, which state Housing Australia and not NHFIC.
    </p>
<h2>01 September 2023 - Home Guarantee Scheme – FY24 Required Documents Update</h2>
<p>FY23 ATO Notice of Assessment estimates will no longer be accepted from 1 September 2023. Please ensure you have obtained your customer’s FY23 (ending 30 June 2023) ATO Notice of Assessment (NOA) or evidence of non-lodgement and attach to your customer’s application prior to submission.</p>
<p>
<strong><u>Important</u>: </strong>If customer does not have a valid FY23 NOA due to the following reasons:
    </p>
<ol>
<li>Applicant(s) do not have a TFN; OR</li>
<li>Applicant(s) were previously working overseas and obtained a TFN on/after 1 July 2023 and thus are not able to obtain an FY23 NOA</li>

<h2>
        01<sup> </sup>July 2023 - Home Guarantee Scheme – FY24 Expanded Eligibility Criteria
    </h2>
<p>
<strong>
<br/>
            Assisting more home buyers with the expanded Eligibility Criteria</strong>
</p>
<p>The Home Guarantee Scheme (HGS) will be expanding their Eligibility Criteria from 1 July 2023 for the FY24 implementation of the scheme.</p>
<p>The first change will enable Australian Permanent Residents, in addition to Citizens, to apply for all the schemes currently on offer; i.e the First Home Buyer Guarantee, Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee and the Family Home Guarantee.</p>
<p>Where joint applications previously required the applicants to be either married or defacto with each other, moving forward the FY24 First Home Buyer and Regional First Home Buyer Guarantees will allow joint applications irrespective of their marital status; i.e. friends, siblings and other family members will be able to participate.</p>
<p>The First Home and Regional First Home Buyer Guarantees will also allow non-first home buyers to join the schemes, ensuring they have not owned a property in Australia in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Lastly, single legal guardians such as aunts, uncles and grandparents will be eligible alongside single natural or adoptive parents for the FY24 Family Home Guarantee.</p>
<p>
<strong>What you need to know</strong>
</p>
<p>
        From <strong>Saturday 1 July 2023,</strong> the FY24 scheme places will be made available. Please note that the above expanded eligibility criteria will only apply to applicants who have scheme reservations made on or after 1 July 2023. FY23 scheme places or prior will continue to abide by the previous eligibility criteria.<strong>
<br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> NAB can support your customers with HGS applications submitted under the current FY23 eligibility. There will however be a small interim period where NAB cannot accept applications under the FY24 new expanded eligibility criteria (see below for new expanded eligibility) while we upgrade our lodgement systems to support these new requirements.
    </p>
<p>We anticipate that NAB will be in a position to accept new FY24 eligibility applications from late July 2023. Keep an eye out for further communication in the coming weeks to provide you with updated information and verification requirements needed.</p>

</a> to join the waitlist for Permanent Residents and/or joint applicants who are not married or de facto.</strong> This will allow us to contact you in due course to submit the application once our lodgement systems are updated.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>FY24 Marital evidence for Married/De-Facto:</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the FY24 change, we will no longer be required to evidence Married/de facto status for joint applicants under the First Home Buyer or Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee schemes.</p>
<p>
        Please note that this only applies for scheme places reserved on or after 1 July 2023. <strong>If reserved an FY23 scheme place</strong>, we will still require marital status evidence as previously highlighted. Whilst it’s still mandatory to try and obtain evidence to confirm de facto status for joint applicants (if not married), you will now be able to use the Home Buyer Declaration if efforts to obtain other forms of evidence from your customers are not possible.
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Input a</strong> <strong>note or provide an email</strong> detailing effort in obtaining the other forms of evidence, and if unable to obtain that you are relying on Home Buyer Declaration to evidence the De Facto status. (FY23 or prior scheme places only)
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>What’s next?</strong>
<br/>
        Start conversations with your customers about how you can help them buy their new home sooner with only a 5% deposit for the First Home Guarantee, Regional First Home Buyers Guarantee or 2% deposit for the Family Home Guarantee with no Lenders Mortgage Insurance. Then, get them ready to complete their conditional approval application so they have the best chance of securing a new Scheme place when it’s released on 1 July 2023.

<h2>
        09<sup> </sup>May 2023 - Home Guarantee Scheme – Evidence Requirements Update
    </h2>
<p>
<strong>
<br/>
            Making evidence requirements easier for our customers</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>What you need to know</strong>
</p>
<p>
        From <strong>Thursday 4 May 2023,</strong> the evidence requirements for certain Home Guarantee Scheme applications criteria will be improved to reduce roadblocks and pain points. This will also support easier processing allowing for a shorter time to unconditional approval for applications under the Home Guarantee Schemes.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Marital Status for De-Facto:</strong>
</p>
<p>Whilst it’s still mandatory to try and obtain evidence to confirm de facto status for joint applicants (if not married), you will now be able to use the Home Buyer Declaration if efforts to obtain other forms of evidence from your customers are not possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Input a</strong> <strong>note or provide an email</strong> detailing effort in obtaining the other forms of evidence, and if unable to obtain that you are relying on Home Buyer Declaration to evidence the De Facto status.
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Home Buyer Declaration:</strong>
</p>
<p>If a customer hasn’t provided the Home Buyer Declaration in its entirety, we now just need to ensure the customer has completed the required sections for the scheme type they have entered into to proceed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Example:</strong> if a First Home Buyer Guarantee application, then you would need to ensure at a minimum that Parts A, D and F are completed and returned (pages 1-5, 9, 11 &amp; 12) instead of requiring all pages (1-12) to be provided.
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Regional First Home Buyer – Evidence of Living in an eligible Regional Area:</strong>
</p>
<p>If your customer is unable to provide the current forms of evidence, they can now provide documentation that evidence the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>their name/s</li>
<li>address (in an eligible regional area)</li>
<li>
            length of <a>time</a> – whether frequency in terms of month, quarterly, half yearly, yearly or in terms of a period, i.e. January to March 2023 can be accepted.
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> This evidence must be an authentic document provided by a company/organisation and <strong>can’t be</strong> a document created for the purposes of meeting this evidence requirement, i.e. a word document.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Retained Savings:</strong>
</p>
<p>NHFIC require customers to utilise as much of their deposit with regards to the Home Guarantee Schemes and not to minimise their deposit provided to maximise LVR. Improved work instructions will be provided to ensure brokers are aware of this requirement.</p>

<h2>
<a>24 JUNE 2022 – Home Guarantee Scheme FY23 Release from 1 July 2022</a>
</h2>
<p>
<strong>Home Guarantee Scheme – open for conditional approval applications at NAB</strong>
</p>
<p>
        NAB is pleased to continue helping customers with the <strong>Home Guarantee Scheme</strong>, which includes the <strong>First Home Guarantee</strong> (<strong>FHBG</strong> - previously known as the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme or FHLDS) and <strong>Family Home Guarantee (FHG)</strong>, announced as part of the 2022-2023 Federal Budget.
        <br/>

        You can now submit conditional approval applications for customers wanting to buy or build their first home with the <strong>First Home Guarantee </strong>or the <strong>Family Home Guarantee</strong> and join NAB’s priority list for a Scheme place (subject to meeting key customer and property eligibility criteria).
    </p>
<p>
        Your customer must <strong>obtain formal conditional approval</strong> before being added to our priority list and will be <strong>reserved a place from 1 July 2022</strong> onwards when the new places are released. Check the requirements for submitting your customer’s application (including eligibility and income evidence) below.
    </p>

<h2>15 February 2022 - first home guarantee waitlist closed effective COB 16 February 2022.</h2>
