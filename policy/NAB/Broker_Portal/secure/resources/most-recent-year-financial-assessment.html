<h2>When is utilising the most recent year trading appropriate?</h2>
<p>Brokers are required to undertake further analysis and assessment of the customer’s capacity to repay debt when using the most recent year financials in the assessment to confirm that the results are sustainable and the underlying reasons for growth are well understood.</p>
<p>Analysis should include asking the customer questions and focusing on key items in the financial statements that are contributing to the net profit being higher in the current year compared to the previous year. It does not require every line of the financial statements to be commented on.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of what should be considered when basing an assessment on the one year of financial performance:</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>Recovered from COVID impacts or a competing bakery across the road closed, new contract with an existing customer secured etc</li>
<li>The customer has lost a major contract which has made the previous year trading not suitable for inclusion in the servicing calculation.</li>
<li>How do we gain comfort the financials are sustainable and reliable for beyond a 12-month term?</li>
<li>Is the business trading or not trading?</li>
<li>What is the underlying reason for stronger or weaker trading results in the most current financial year? What are the key drivers?</li>
<li>Gross Profit Margin has increased considerably – how or why?</li>
<li>A new supplier overseas has reduced the cost of customer’s main inputs, products are being sent direct from the supplier to customer, reducing transport and holding costs in the warehouse, new discount from supplier for bulk purchase has improved the margin per item sold etc</li>

<p>Other stand out items in operating expenses that have significantly varied compared to the previous year contributing to the significant increase in Net Profit in most recent year financials. Understand how or why this has occurred.</p>
<p>Examples of how to apply this below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overtime and penalty wages significantly reduced due to improved workforce management system, measuring output productivity and peak staffing requirements, temporary pop up store that was loss making has closed reducing rent and staffing cost etc</li>
<li>The customers trust owns a property and in FY20 there were a number or renovation expenses however FY21 expenses show significantly reduced expenses and increased rental income. The most recent year trading would be more appropriate in this scenario due to the improvement of the income generating asset now complete and utilising the previous years activities would not reflect future performance .</li>
<li>The customer has lost a major competitor and customer has decided to downsize business operations. Previous year net profit significantly higher than current year.</li>

        The customer provides online learning and development software and support. Their business has grown their sales from $3,200,000 (2017) to $3,500,000 (2018), a sales increase of 9.5%. The Net Profit has increased by 30% from $800,000 to $1,040,000.

        The customers trust purchased an income producing asset in February which is currently leased. The customer explains that the most recent year is reflective of the trusts ongoing profitability due to a full year of rental income where as the prior year only included 4 months of income. This has been verified against the gross rental income increase in the profit and loss.
        <br/>
</p>
<h4>
<strong>Broker captures their rationale in commentary:</strong>
</h4>
<p>The customer purchased an investment property midway through the previous year which is evident in the substantial increase to gross income within the profit and loss. The most recent years business activities are what is projected to occurred going forward.</p>
<h4>
<strong>Good Commentary Examples</strong>
</h4>
<p>When the Banker asked the customer whether the customers business was impacted by COVID they advised that while they we're initially impacted during the Melbourne lockdowns however they have since recovered.</p>
<p>The Banker reviews the financial statements and can see an obvious difference between the gross income being generated in the impacted year. The Banker confirms with the customer that the most recent year is a better reflection of regular trading.</p>
