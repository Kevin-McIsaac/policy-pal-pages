<h3>CARE: effective 25 May 2020 for new NAB Broker (excluding Commercial Broker) lending applications, individual guarantors providing guarantees to individual borrowers must be in a spousal or de-facto relationship with the borrower.</h3>
<h3>Applications for variations and amendments of an existing guaranteed loan will continue to be accepted.</h3>
<p>Home Loan applications requiring guarantees for all other purposes can continue to be processed by Retail, Direct and Broker channels. This includes guarantees from companies and trustees.</p>
<p>
        Customers’ obligations are different between being a guarantor and being a co-borrower (further details can be found on <a adhocenable="false" href="https://policyhub.cts.nab.com.au/Lending/Pages/Understanding-Your-Customer-UYC001.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UYC001 – Understanding Your Customer<span class="sr-only">, opens in a new window</span>

    </p>
<p>Brokers must explain that:</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 40.0px; ">
        - where there is more than one customer involved with a loan, NAB only accepts co-borrowers where they have substantial benefit from the loan unless they are spouses or defactos;
        <br/>
        - for spouses and defactos without substantial benefit, the co-borrower eligibility requirements must be met.
    </p>
<p>If the customers want a guarantee relationship or don’t meet our eligibility requirements to be co-borrowers, brokers should ask these customers to use an alternative provider.</p>

<a id="6.4"></a>6.4 Types of Guarantors and Guarantor Assessment for Suitability
        <br/>
</h2>
<p>A Guarantee must only be accepted from a guarantor who is assessed as being suitable. A Guarantor Assessment for Suitability must be completed for all guarantors and requirements differ according to guarantor types (refer to below table).</p>
<p>When assessing the suitability of a guarantor, brokers must:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask the guarantor why they are agreeing to provide the Guarantee; and,</li>
<li>
            be able to show that the guarantor’s decision to provide the Guarantee was freely made, fully informed and had a reasonable basis.
            <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<u>Do not proceed</u> with taking a Guarantee in the following situations: 
    </p>
<ul>
<li>where there are any signs to indicate that the Guarantee is not being provided on a voluntary basis, including (but not limited to) signs of undue influence, coercion, duress or inappropriate pressure from the borrower, co-guarantors or third parties; </li>
<li>where the individual guarantor reveals in any way that they do not understand the nature and effect of their obligations under the Guarantee and the financial risks associated with providing the Guarantee;</li>
<li>where there is evidence of cognitive impairment;</li>
<li>where the individual guarantor, for any reason, is unable to read the documents for themselves in their original printed form or does not appear to understand the documents; or,</li>
<li>
            where there are reputational, ethical or other reasons that would prevent NAB from enforcing the Guarantee or supporting security at some future date.
            <br/>
</li>
</ul>

<strong>For Commercial Broker Home Loan applications only:</strong></br></p>
<p>Where a broker is submitting their own home lending application for finance, (i.e., where the broker is the borrower and/or guarantor in the transaction), they cannot complete the Guarantor Assessment for Suitability on their own behalf, or for any party related to the transaction. In this scenario, the business banker is required to complete the Guarantor Assessment for Suitability requirements for each guarantor.<br>
