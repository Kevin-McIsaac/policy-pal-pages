        <a id="10.2.2"></a>10.2.2 How to treat Allowances
    </h3>
    
    <p>Some reoccurring Employee Allowances which are received regularly and are not temporary or seasonal can be included as PAYG income, as long as they can be validated and evidenced in two consecutive payslips.</p>
    
    <p>Employee Allowances may include (but not be limited to):</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>shift</li>
        <li>uniform</li>

    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Where Allowance amount is inconsistent and the variance is less than or equal to 20%, use the lower of the allowance value.
    </p>
    
    <p>The income must be treated as Overtime where Employee Allowance/s either:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>can&rsquo;t be determined as recurring but are included in Year To Date (YTD) pay slip balances</li>
        <li>have a greater than 20% variance between either payslip or YTD income values.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> When including the allowance as income, care needs to be taken that the corresponding expense is allowed for, in the customer&rsquo;s expense e.g. Grooming, travel allowance etc.

        <a id="10.2.3"></a>10.2.3 How to treat Deductions including Salary Sacrifice/HECS Debt
    </h3>
    
    <p>Employer Deductions including salary sacrifice do not require further enquiry where net income after deductions is used and debt servicing remains evident.</p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>HECS-HELP Debts</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>HECS-HELP debts are repaid via the ATO taxation system. When a customer earns above the minimum income threshold their required repayment percentage will be deducted by their employer as an additional taxation amount.</p>
    
    <p>When recording a &lsquo;HECS&rsquo; liability enter the customer declared limit/balance outstanding and the attributed taxation percentage should be recorded as a liability repayment.</p>
    
    <p>Employee Deduction can be added back to gross income where either:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>the deduction can be evidenced as a repayment being declared in the application (e.g: car lease or home loan repayments)</li>
        <li>expenses actually incurred are reflected in the customers declared general living expenses (i.e: Meals card, parking)</li>
        <li>the deduction can be verified as being cancelled.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Employee deductions removed from income used in debt servicing do not require further inquiry to be made where servicing remains evident.</p>
    
    <p>
        To add back deductions, including salary sacrifice, to the customers base wage <strong>brokers must</strong>:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Verify the type of deduction, and document that there is clear rationale as to why it is an acceptable deduction to add back; and</li>
        <li>Tax will apply in accordance with the below table:</li>
    </ul>

<p>* If there is no post tax deduction then the liability repayment must be input as $1</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>PAYG income may be included where a customer is returning to work after extended leave such as career breaks, long service leave, sabbaticals, parental leave etc.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Brokers must:</strong>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Confirm customer&rsquo;s return to work date, employment status and salary by obtaining a letter from the customer&rsquo;s employer .</li>
        <li>Confirm customer&rsquo;s intended strategy to service the lending until return to work date and record it via an application note.</li>
        <li>Ensure any return-to-work costs (e.g. child care) are considered in the customers living expenses..</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Below are examples of acceptable strategies while on extended leave:&nbsp;</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Existing savings</li>
        <li>Access to funds e.g., Home Loan Redraw/repayments in advance</li>
        <li>Income to be received over leave period&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Loan repayment deferral/amendment such as loan repayment holiday or reduce contracted loan repayments&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Use of actual loan repayments (DCA Level 3 approval required)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Alternative option for parental leave verification:&nbsp;</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>Where a letter isn&rsquo;t obtained, and customers are about to commence or are currently on parental leave alternative verification can be completed&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>Brokers must:&nbsp;</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Confirm the customer is employed as Permanent Full Time/Part Time Employee; and</li>
        <li>Confirm their intended return to work employment details after parental leave period expires, including hours; and</li>
        <li>Input the customers income according to their return-to-work employment arrangement; and</li>
        <li>Verify the customers base wage (a dated payslip is acceptable outside the standard 45/90 day document criteria); and</li>
        <li>Confirm how the customer will meet debt servicing commitments over the period of parental leave, in addition to the loan contract term.</li>

    <p>The Australian Government regularly makes changes to eligibility criteria for Government payments.</p>
    
    <p>The below table sets out the payment types and whether 'system assessment' or 'manual assessment' is required, along with providing guidance on payments that cannot be considered for debt servicing.</p>
    
    <p>Due to the Department of Human Services varying eligibility criteria and means testing associated with some payments, applications containing government payments need to be referred to a DCA holder to consider:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Each customer's individual circumstances and overall strength of their application (including assets, liabilities and , consistency and reliability of all income including government payments);</li>
        <li>Impacts that the proposed transaction may have on their government payment (particularly in relation to income and asset testing);</li>
        <li>The intended duration of the payment and its availability to rely on for the term of the loan; and</li>
        <li>NAB's responsible lending obligation to ensure that the loan is not unsuitable.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To ensure appropriate consideration is provided to all customers, income sources that require manual assessment must be referred to an appropriate DCA holder for a full review before a customer is provided an outcome on their loan.</p>
