<a id="intro"></a>Introduction
    </h2>
<p>
        When taking a loan application, we must understand the customer’s requirements, objectives and financial situation. Including (but not limited to):
        <br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>purpose for the loan</li>
<li>income</li>
<li>current and post general living and entertainment expenses</li>
<li>minimum $500 Board or Rental expense per month (post loan only) must be input where a customer will not live in their owner occupied PPR home or live with their spouse/de-facto post drawdown.</li>
<li>the source of the customer's deposit (initial or current) and if it includes repayable non-genuine savings (such as an advance/gift from family or friends that must be repaid)</li>
<li>current and post liabilities and debt repayments, including any repayable non-genuine savings (ie: loan funded deposit from family/friends)</li>
<li>
            whether the customer has experienced any previous form of financial hardship (not limited to dealings with NAB), within the past two years (including where they are still on a repayment pause); and; whether the customer expects there will be a change in their future financial circumstances, such as
            <ul>
<li>Extended unpaid leave (e.g. parental leave)</li>
<li>Reduced income</li>
<li>End of contract (loss of employment/redundancy)</li>
<li>Increased debt repayments for an existing loan</li>
<li>Large expenditure</li>
<li>Medical treatment/illness</li>
<li>
                    Impacts of a pandemic or natural disaster e.g.
                    <ul>
<li>reduced working hours as a result of lockdown restrictions</li>
<li>reduced tourism</li>
<li>stock delivery delays, impacting ability to operate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any other financial issues that are likely to cause the customer’s financial position to be materially worse than their financial position described in your application</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Details of the loan application must be captured on the customer file.</p>

<h2>
<a id="2.1"></a>2.1 Responsible Lending Obligations
    </h2>
<p>Your responsible lending obligations require you to make reasonable enquiries about the customer(s) objectives, financial situation and requirements including taking reasonable steps to verify their information. You must make an assessment that a particular loan with a particular credit provider is not unsuitable for the client.</p>
<p>The National Consumer Credit Protection (NCCP) including National Credit Code (NCC) regulates the form and content of consumer credit documents and the conduct of consumer credit providers. It applies where the purpose is:</p>
<ul>
<li>For personal, domestic or household uses or</li>
<li>To purchase, renovate or improve a residential investment property; or</li>
<li>To refinance credit that was originally for either of the above two purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the loan is NCCP regulated you must not provide credit assistance if the consumer could not meet their obligations or could do so only with substantial hardship.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility, under the responsible lending obligations of NCCP, to verify the financial situation of the applicant. You must also establish whether the applicant can meet their obligations without substantial hardship.</p>

<h2>
<a id="2.2"></a>2.2 Co-Borrower Benefit
    </h2>
<p>
        Brokers must ensure all co-borrowers on a loan facility receive a “<b>Substantial Benefit</b>” from the loan proceeds and helps to protect vulnerable members of our society from financial abuse. 
    </p>
<h3>Substantial Benefit</h3>
<p>
        An Individual can only be accepted as a co-borrower where it can be evidenced that they receive a ‘<b>Substantial Benefit</b>’ from the loan proceeds. 
    </p>
<p>For new home loans and increases involving joint applicants, brokers must identify whether each individual co-borrower will receive a substantial benefit.    </p>
<p>This is not required for company borrowers or individual borrowers who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>acting in their capacity as trustee;</li>
<li>directors of co-borrower companies;</li>
<li>partners in a partnership;</li>
<li>in a joint venture arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<p>
        A ‘<b>Substantial Benefit</b>’ includes where: 
    </p>
<ul>
<li>Each co-borrower acquires a reasonably proportionate legal or equitable interest in assets purchased with the loan funds; or </li>
<li>Each co-borrower utilises a reasonable portion of the loans funds to repay their debts or other obligations owed by the co-borrower; or </li>
<li>Each co-borrower will utilise and have access to a reasonable portion of the loan funds which is not covered above (for example, a holiday, medical expenses, household goods etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum percentage required to achieve ‘Substantial Benefit’ is set out below:</p>
</root>
</div>
<div class="table text"><div class="cmp-text" id="table-df388430c7">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th>Number of Individual Co-Borrowers </th><th>Minimum amount deemed ‘Substantial Benefit’</th></tr><tr><td>2 to 4 </td><td>Minimum 25%</td></tr><tr><td>5 or more</td><td>Equal share<br>
</br></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<div class="text">
<root>
<h3>Structuring Options</h3>
<p>In cases where a Substantial Benefit cannot be demonstrated, Brokers must discuss with the proposed co-borrower:</p>
<ul>
<li>why they want to be a co-borrower; and</li>
<li>alternative structuring options such as providing a security guarantee, or subject to meeting credit policy requirements, becoming a servicing guarantor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The customer needs to understand the risks associated with entering into the loan, and understand the difference between being a co-borrower and a guarantor. You must recommend the customer obtain independent legal and financial advice before we accept an individual without Substantial Benefit as a co-borrower.</p>
</root>
</div>
<div class="table text"><div class="cmp-text" id="table-8798e7499a">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th>Co-Borrower Liability </th><th>Guarantor liability </th></tr><tr><td><p>A co-borrower may have to repay the entire amount owing alone.</p>
<p>The bank does not have to ask any other co-borrower to repay before it asks any other co-borrower, or at the same time the bank asks any other co-borrower;</p>
<p>This is because each co-borrower is each individually and directly responsible for the loan repayment obligations. If there’s a problem with repayment of the loan, the bank may pursue all co-borrowers or any one of them individually for the amount owing.</p>
</td><td><p>A Guarantor is someone who promises to repay money that is owed to us under a loan, if for some reason the borrower doesn’t. If the individual were a guarantor instead of a borrower, the bank may be required to take steps against the borrower before it can enforce mortgages given by the guarantor or judgements against the guarantor.</p>
<p>A guarantor may be able to limit their liability in accordance with the Banking Code of Practice and legislation. A guarantor may also be able to ask for contribution from the borrower/s and from other guarantors. The Banking Code of Practice and the law generally provide other protections to guarantors that will not apply to a borrower.</p>

<h3>Accepting Co-Borrowers without Substantial Benefit</h3>
<p>
        NAB Broker, excluding Commercial Broker, has no appetite for new lending for Co-Borrowers who are <b><u>not</u> </b>in a spousal/de-facto relationship, where any Co-Borrower will not receive a Substantial Benefit.
    </p>
<p>NAB Broker has limited appetite for amendments and variations to existing lending for Co-Borrowers who are not in a spousal/de-facto relationship, where any Co-Borrower will not receive a Substantial Benefit. A minimum DCA Level 3 approval is required for these applications.</p>
<p>Where an Individual Co-Borrower does not receive a ‘Substantial Benefit’ from the loan requested, and does not wish to be a Guarantor, you may accept them as a co-borrower using the exception process provided the following requirements are met. </p>
<p>The Broker:</p>
<ul>
<li>
            has provided to each co-borrower not receiving as substantial benefit the <a class="no-style" href="/secure/forms-and-calculators/customer-forms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">Co-borrower Information Sheet</a> and <a class="no-style" href="/secure/forms-and-calculators/customer-forms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">Guarantor Information Sheet</a>.
        </li>
<li>has considered and documented the reasons why that individual wants to be a Co-Borrower, and the rationale supplied does not raise concerns;</li>
<li>is satisfied that the Individual Co-Borrower without a Substantial Benefit is not experiencing financial abuse by completing the financial abuse check list and has not identified any other signs of financial abuse; </li>
<li>has recommended the Co-Borrower obtain independent legal and financial advice in order to understand the risks associated with entering into the loan and the difference between being a Co-Borrower and a Guarantor; and</li>
<li>Having given the proposed co-borrower an opportunity to consider their options and the co-borrower has indicated they want to proceed as a co-borrower, ensures the Co-Borrower has reviewed and duly executed the ‘Personal Consent form’ prior to submission.</li>
