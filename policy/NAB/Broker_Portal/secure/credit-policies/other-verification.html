<h2>
<a id="11.1"></a>11.1 Loan purpose
    </h2>
<p>Cash out is defined as the total funds being released to borrowers on an uncontrolled basis.</p>
<p>Brokers must make inquires with the customer to understand the purpose of the cash out/equity release and how it meets the customers’ needs and objectives and record a note on the application when taking a Principal and Interest, or Interest Only Loan Term Loan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the cash out is the predominant purpose of the loan, you must enter the purpose of the cash out as the loan purpose in the application.</li>
<li>Where an LMI policy will be established, and the cash out is more than $100,000 or LVR exceeds 90% verify a minimum of 80% of the total funds being released to borrowers on an uncontrolled basis using acceptable documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of supporting documents are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Builders quote</li>
<li>Purchase contract</li>
<li>Confirmation from a financial planner or accountant as to the intended use of funds</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Where the cash out/equity release is for a deposit on a future property purchase, and additional lending will be required to complete the purchase, a note must be completed to ensure the customer can fulfil the needs and objectives of the cash out request.</p>
