##  Will CBA allow me to use casual income for a client employed for 5 months?
Yes, if employed for 6 or more months in same industry/employment role. This is subject to six months' salary credits* to an account and either
1) One payslip showing < six months YTD income (from current employer) or
1) Letter from current employer or employment agency detailing:

   * current employment arrangement (working hours / hourly rate)
   * length of employment
   * break up of YTD income

The amount to use in servicing will be the lower of the annualised average of the last 6 months’ salary credits and the annualised current payslip/letter.

***Note**: Six months’ salary credits will include more than 1 employer but each employer must be in same industry / role. Bank statements (including internet banking transaction listings) must be from the bank where the salary is credited.

Care must be taken if the frequency of pay changed between employers.
