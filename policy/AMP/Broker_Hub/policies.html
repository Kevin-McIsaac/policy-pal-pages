<li><span class="text--dark-grey">Can be used for:</span><ul>

<li><span class="text--dark-grey">Refinance of a business debt that related to a closed/liquidated business where the income source to meet servicing is from an entirely unrelated entity. In other words, was self-employed but is now working as a PAYG employee.</span></li>
<li><span class="text--dark-grey">Funds to invest in a commercial property if the customer is not intending to operate his/her/their own business from the premises. This is considered investment and is subject to standard commercial rental income discounts etc.<br/>

</div>
<div class="rich-text-editor parbase">
<h3>Personal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Debt consolidation - maximum 5 debts (home loan and 4 unsecured debts, subject to a maximum of $50,000 accumulated unsecured debt). Personal and/or other loans that resulted in the acquisition of an asset (eg: car loan) may be excluded from the $50,000 accumulated amount. If the applicant/s are unable to provide evidence for the original use of the funds, the loan should be included in the $50,000 cap.</li>

<h3>Cash Out Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>0 - 80% LVR - Cash out up to $500k for LVR &lt; 70% and $250k where the LVR is &gt; 70% is acceptable without evidence of use of funds (declared loan purpose) provided negative gearing in not required to assist with servicing. Cash out greater than these parameters must have evidence of the use of funds submitted as part of the supporting documentation by way of a Stat Dec and where available, may include additional documentation as follows:<ul>
<li>Contract of sale.</li>
<li>Letter from a qualified accountant/financial planner.</li>
<li>Active share trading account.</li>
<li>Quotes/contracts etc for home improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&gt;80% - 90% LVR - Cash out component limited to 20% of the security value and subject to supporting documentation as per above.</li>
<li>Maximum cash out is $1m (refer to your BDM).</li>

<h3>Housing </h3>
<ul>
<li>Purchase new or existing residential dwelling for owner occupation or investment.</li>
<li>Construct new residential dwelling for owner occupation or investment.</li>

<li>Maximum LVR for purchase, construction, increase of or refinance of investment housing/property debt is 80% on I/O repayment terms and 90% on P&amp;I repayment terms (owner/occupied and personal purpose is 90% plus LMI, investment property lending is 90% inclusive of LMI).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refinance on a dollar for dollar basis is acceptable on both P&amp;I repayment terms (max LVR for owner/occupied is 90% plus LMI and investment property lending is 90% inclusive of LMI) and I/O repayment terms (max LVR 80% – including Master Limits). If the existing loan being refinanced is non-deductible and on interest only repayment terms, it is acceptable to mimic the same structure (subject to AMP Bank being satisfied the selection meets with the requirements and objectives of the applicant/s) however if cash out is also sought for non-deductible debt, the cash out portion must be on P&amp;I repayment terms.<br/>

<h3>Bridging Policy </h3>
<p>If a simultaneous settlement cannot be negotiated and the purchase is required prior to the sale, we may consider bridging finance (for existing customers only) under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing mortgage has been with AMP Bank for &gt; six months and repayments have been maintained per contractual arrangements.</li>
<li>The incoming security satisfies acceptable property/s policy and is subject to a satisfactory valuation.</li>
<li>Where the existing home is not subject to an unconditional exchange of contracts, servicing is demonstrated on the 'peak debt' should the existing home be retained and become an investment property.<ul>
<li>Rental income and gearing benefits to be applied per current policy.</li>
<li>Primary LMI not required.</li>
<li>No zone 5 (Ultra-High Risk) securities regardless of LVR.</li>
<li>Max LVR subject to standard policy based on $TBE.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="rich-text-editor parbase">
<ul>
<li>If the existing home has been sold and unconditional exchange of contracts can be verified, we may consider acceptance if servicing can be demonstrated on the proposed end debt but not the peak debt subject to:<ul>
<li>Unconditional exchange and payment of the deposit by the purchaser to be confirmed in writing from the borrower's legal representative.</li>
<li>The letter is also to confirm that AMP bank's borrower is entitled to retain the deposit proceeds should the sale not proceed.</li>
<li>The settlement for the sale of the existing home is to be affected within 30 days from the purchase of the new property - as confirmed via the COS and/or confirmation via the applicant/s legal representative.</li>
<li>Tracking of the sale of the existing home, within 30 days from the settlement for the new purchase of the new home, is to be maintained and monitored within bank Operations and reported to the Credit Specialist Team if not complied with.</li>
<li>Primary LMI not required.</li>
<li>No zone 5 (Ultra-High Risk) securities regardless of LVR.</li>
<li>Max LVR subject to standard policy based on $TBE.</li>

<h3>Quantity Surveyor </h3>
<ul>
<li>For construction loan amounts &gt;$1 million the Bank will appoint, at the borrowers expense, a quantity surveyor (QS) to prepare a report on the fixed price construction cost compared to the QS costing of the project.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell small-12 xlarge-6">
<div class="rich-text-editor parbase">
<h3>Conditions </h3>
<ul>
<li>Must be in a product that offers construction loan feature. Product mixing is acceptable for existing facilities and remaining loan amounts not used for construction (cannot be combined with AMP Essential Home Loans)</li>
<li>Construction must be completed within 12 months of loan approval</li>
<li>Maximum of 2 dwellings to be constructed per borrower at one time.</li>
<li>The Bank will accept the lower of valuer's estimate of improvements or the fixed price building contract figure.<ul>
<li>This typically only applies to new builds or knockdown rebuilds. Where the cost of renovations is greater than $100,000 and is applied as a construction loan, the value of the improvements 'on completion' from the valuation may be accepted given the existing dwelling already carries existing value. For example, existing home is worth $2m and is split $1.5m for the land and $0.500m for improvements. The customer now approaches the Bank with a fixed price contract of $0.300m for renovations and the new on completion valuation estimates the new value as $2.25m, split $1.5m for the land and $0.750m for improvements. In this case we do not apply the contract value of $0.300m as the total value for improvements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prior to Formal Approval, the Bank requires copies of<br/>
<ul>
<li>Fixed price building contract, tender or detailed cost estimate from a licensed builder (does not have to be an eecuted copy)</li>
<li>Plans and specifications (does not have to be Council approved)</li>
<li>Any variations to the fixed price building contract and/or additional quotations from a licensed contractor</li>
<li>One week prior to the first progress payment, the Bank requires copies of:<ul>
<li>Executed fixed price building contract (final valuation may be required at Borrowers expense).<br/>
<b>Note</b>: this may be required earlier if the Bank's panel valuer requests.</li>
<li>Council Approved Plans and specifications (final valuation may be required at Borrowers expense).</li>
<li>Any variations to the fixed price building contract and/or additional quotations from a licensed contractor. If the customer requires additional funds to cover the variation, an increase and reassessment will apply.</li>

<h3>Borrowers approaching retirement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Evidence of an exit strategy is required to confirm the debt can be repaid without hardship when the borrower is approaching retirement age (greater than or equal to 50 years old at the time of loan application).</li>
<li>A written exit strategy is a mandatory part of the supporting docs and must be provided by the originator at the time of lodgement - can comprise the Borrower/Broker Interview Guide (B.I.G).</li>
<li>The exit strategy should include:<ul>
<li>The expected retirement age of the applicant(s).</li>
<li>The assets available to either pay out the loan upon retirement or continue to make repayments after retirement. These may include investment properties, superannuation, term deposits, other investments etc.</li>
<li>If downsizing to a smaller home, a detailed plan showing timeframe, expected sale and purchase price is required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A financial plan or statement of advice from a qualified Financial Planner showing the exit strategy or ongoing repayment capability will be accepted in place of the exit strategy above.</li>
<li>If no exit strategy has been provided then the loan term must not exceed the expected age of retirement. AMP Bank will deem a customer's retirement age to be 70 unless we are advised that a borrower is planning to retire prior to 70.</li>
<li>No exit strategy or reduction in loan term is required if the loan services based on other income, such as rental, annuities and investments assuming that income is expected to continue for the full term of the loan.</li>
<li>All loans under this policy should be on Principal and Interest repayments (no interest only) unless it is clearly evident the Borrowers will be able to service any remaining Principal repayments based on the term remaining after any Interest Only period.</li>
<li>If the purpose of the loan is investment property and the borrower(s) have an existing owner occupied property then this policy does not apply.</li>

<h3>Borrowers already retired and/ or aged 60+</h3>
<ul>
<li>Borrowers that have already retired or are aged 60 years or older (oldest applicant if joint borrowing) AND wish to provide their owner-occupied home as security where a valid and verifiable exit strategy cannot be demonstrated:<ul>
<li>Will be subject to a maximum loan term of 10 years on P&amp;I repayment terms.</li>
<li>If an applicant wishes to leverage equity from his/her/their owner-occupied home to assist with the purchase of an investment property:<ul>
<li>AMP Bank will consider a maximum loan term of 10 years against the owner-occupied security under loan 1 (standalone); and</li>
<li>AMP Bank will consider a maximum loan term of 30 years against the investment security under loan 2 (standalone).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Note</b>: Existing borrowers that fall into this category (retired/aged 60 or older AND have the owner-occupied property as part of the security) can apply for an increase subject to the remaining loan term on the system. If the loan term is to be extended, it can only be extended to a maximum loan term of 10 years – refer to the following examples for guidance:<ul>
<li>Loan was approved 3 years ago over a loan term of 30 years. The increase must be assessed on the remaining term of 27 years (discounting any applicable I/O period) ie: the loan cannot be extended back to 30 years under an internal refinance;</li>
<li>Loan was approved 13 years ago over a loan term of 20 years. The increase must be assessed on the remaining term of 7 years however may be extended back to a maximum term of 10 years ie: max extension of 3 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where a valid and verifiable exit strategy can be demonstrated, the loan term may be extended up to a maximum of 30 years, subject to:<ul>
<li>Where the loan term exceeds 10 years, a minimum NMS of $500 is required (regardless of DTI and LVR).</li>
<li>The exit strategy may include:<ul>
<li>Liquid assets (cash, shares, superannuation etc)</li>
<li>Equity in investment property</li>
<li>Equity/value of a business</li>
<li>The value of the above acceptable asset classes must be greater than the value of the loan at the time of application. We will not accept forecast growth to mitigate an approval.</li>
<li>The exit strategy must also not include downsizing of the PPOR regardless of the LVR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supporting documentation may include:<ul>
<li>Liquid assets: evidence of the deposit holding (Term Deposits etc), superannuation statement and/or shareholding printout from a licenced financial planner, accountant or an accepted site including Link Market Services, Commsec, Computershare etc confirming the name, address, individual holdings and value at the time of submission.</li>
<li>Equity in investment properties: current debt confirmed via the bureau report (CCR) or bank statements where not reporting under CCR and an AVM where unencumbered or mortgaged externally - AMP Bank will arrange the AVM internally where required.</li>
<li>Business: supported by a formal valuation or statement from managing accountant (external to the business).</li>

If less than 6 months with current employer, full time/part time workers (including those on probation) must demonstrate a minimum of 12 months continuous employment within the same occupation type (e.g. sales) or industry (e.g. mining). For casual employees and PAYG contractors where the length of employment is less than 6 months, AMP Bank will not accept the income for servicing. For an applicant, that is a casual/contract income worker, who has been with the current employer for a minimum of six months to be acceptable, he/she must have:<ul>

<li>PAYG Contractor:<br/>
Where the analyst is able to determine, via the terms of the current contract, that the applicant is entitled to paid leave and other general entitlements associated with a permanent employee, he/she may proceed with the income assessment based on a full 52-week year subject to being satisfied with the applicant’s employment history and ongoing prospects of continued employment via a contract extension or new contract.

<h3>Rental</h3>
<ul>
<li>Evidence from:<ul>
<li>Current lease or tenancy agreement; or</li>
<li>Estimate of rental from AMP Bank valuation; or</li>
<li>Estimate of rental in writing by letter from licensed real estate agent (must be less than 60 days old); or</li>
<li>A current rental statement from a real estate agent (must be less than 60 days old).</li>
<li>Where multiple sources of income are supplied and one of them is a Lease Agreement, then rental income on the Agreement supersedes all other evidence held and will be used for serviceability purposes.</li>
<li>For the first point above only, it is acceptable to use bank statements to support ongoing receipt of rental income if the documentation has recently expired and the applicant/s are in the process of renewing with the tenant. The receipt of the rental income must post date the expired lease agreement. If however, verification of rental income is available from points (ii) to (iv), bank statements are not required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Where a private lease or tenancy agreement is in place (e.g.: there is no real estate agent involved), then in addition to a copy of the lease or tenancy agreement we also require the last 6 months of bank statements evidencing rental income.<br/>
</li>
<li>The maximum gross rental return included in servicing must be less than or equal to 6%. This applies to all acceptable rental income regardless of whether we take that property as security or not. For example, the annual rental income is $26,000 and the property value is $250,000 we would calculate the rental yield as: Annual Rental Income / Property Value x 100 = Rental Yield $26,000 / $250,000 x 100 = 10.4%. In this example, the rental yield is &gt; 6% therefore we could only use 6% of the property value as the rental figure. Property Value x Floor Rate = Rental Included in Assessment $250,000 x 6% = $15,000 pa. Therefore $15,000 (or $288 per week) can be included as the gross rental income. This amount needs to be discounted further as we will only take 80% of this amount.</li>
<li>The following percentages of rental income will be used for serviceability assessment:</li>

<h3>External Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li>The loan repayment amounts used for the surplus of external mortgages, personal loans, overdrafts, margin loans &amp; lines of credit will be calculated by the higher of:<ul>
<li>The total limit of the external Home Loan, Investment Loan, Margin Loan and/or Line of Credit factored at the loan assessment rate over a 30-year Principal and Interest term on a monthly basis with any interest only period discounted (where known);</li>
<li>The total limit of the external Personal Loan (secured or unsecured) and/or Equipment Finance (Lease, Chattel Mortgage or Hire Purchase excluding the balloon or residual payment) factored at the loan assessment rate over a maximum 5-year Principal and Interest term on a monthly basis, and any Interest Only period discounted from the remaining term (where known), and</li>
<li>The borrowers declared monthly repayment amounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: where known, the actual ‘loan term remaining’ should be captured in the relevant fields (online and/or the manual servicing calculator) to determine the appropriate repayment for servicing.</p>
<p>For all external debt that is not being refinanced/repaid with the new loan funds, the supporting documentation must now include, as a minimum, the most recent statement (within 60 days of the date of the application or if older, supported by an internet banking printout and/or snapshot) for all declared liabilities. The statement/internet banking printout/snapshot must include the current limit/balance and any available redraw, the current interest rate plus the minimum required repayment per month unless the details are available vie the customer bureau report under CCR.<br/>

<h3>
Common debt reducer</h3>
<p>Where rental income from a property is received by two or more parties, the Bank will include the borrower’s portion of rental income/loan repayment for serviceability. e.g. borrower and brother have an equal split investment property loan with another bank. The Bank would include 50% of rental income and 50% of corresponding loan repayment in the serviceability assessment. To enable the Bank to proceed under this arrangement, the co-borrower/s on the existing investment debt must provide evidence of his/her/their ability to meet his/her/their portion of the debt. Refer ‘<a href="/content/dam/distributor/documents/forms/AMP_Bank_Stat_Dec_Common_Debt_Reducer_Non-Borrowing_Relatd_Party.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Statutory Declaration for Non-Borrowing Related Party</a>’ available in the forms section (Home Loan Application Forms) on this site. Where the non-borrowing related party refuses to complete the declaration, the Bank will include 100% of the liability and 100% of the rental income but continue to apply negative gearing based on the relevant % ownership of the property.</p>
<p>Note: The provisions above do not apply for ‘owner occupied’ debt/rental expense held jointly with the applicant’s spouse/partner or another party or ‘investment’ debt held with the applicant’s spouse/partner. Where apportioning of debt is required in a spouse/partner scenario to achieve servicing, the spouse/partner must be considered as a servicing guarantor. Where the other party to the loan is not a spouse/partner, the full debt must be included in servicing. When submitting a loan that includes ‘common debt reducer’ for servicing, you must prepare and include the Bank’s manual <a href="/content/dam/distributor/tools/amp-bank-serviceability-calculator.xlsm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">serviceability calculator</a> as part of your supporting documentation. This is to ensure the correct Debt to Income Ratio is also calculated – for further information, please refer to the Distributor Newsletter published on 11 December 2020 (available in the Newsletters/Awards section of this page).<br/>

<h3>
Monthly living expenses</h3>
<p>When there is an individual borrower who has a spouse/partner, and that spouse/partner is not a party to the loan as co-borrower, for calculating serviceability, the ‘applicant type’ is to be assessed as ‘joint’. If the inclusion of joint living expenses (inclusive of dependents) results in a negative monthly servicing position, the spouse/partner must be included in the application as a ‘servicing guarantor’ to ensure the household position is assessed in its entirety.<br/>
 </p>
</div>
<div class="rich-text-editor parbase">
<h3>
Overseas liabilities</h3>
<p>All overseas liabilities and expenses are to be included in serviceability at 100%. The conversion will be based on the day of the initial credit assessment and the exchange rates published by the Reserve Bank of Australia as per the following site: <a href="http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html" target="_blank">http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html</a></p>
