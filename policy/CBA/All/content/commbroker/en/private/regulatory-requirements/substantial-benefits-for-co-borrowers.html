<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Due to the Banking Code of Practice, for joint applications you will now be required to assess whether each borrower is receiving a Substantial Benefit.</p> 
<p>Substantial Benefit means an equal or greater interest in the use of the loan funds (e.g. Asset/s purchased, debt refinanced or other acceptable purposes).</p> 
<p>See the <a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.commbank.com.au/content/dam/commbank/personal/home-loans/fact-sheets/co-borrower-fact-sheet.pdf?ei=options_co-borrower" target="_blank">Co-Borrower fact sheet</a> for examples of Substantial Benefit&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can include a party as a co-borrower on a Home Loan, Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit application if:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>They're receiving a substantial benefit;&nbsp;<b>or</b></li> 
 <li>They're receiving a benefit that may not be a substantial benefit;&nbsp;<b>and</b>
  <ul> 
   <li style="text-align: justify;">We have taken reasonable steps to make sure they understand the risks associated with entering into the loan, and understand the difference between being a co-borrower and a guarantor;&nbsp;<b>and</b></li> 
   <li style="text-align: justify;">We have taken into account the reasons why they want to be a co-borrower;&nbsp;<b>and</b></li> 
   <li style="text-align: justify;">We're satisfied that they're not experiencing any financial abuse.</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Note </b>– Acceptable Co-Borrower Reason/s must be determined per loan purpose. For support refer through to the below Substantial Benefit Assessment Guide<br /> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Definitions</b></p> 
<p><b>Substantial benefit&nbsp;</b>means an equal or greater interest in the use of the loan funds, e.g. assets purchased, debt refinanced or other acceptable loan purposes.</p> 
<p>A <b>Spouse </b>is defined as a couple who is:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Married or</li> 
 <li>In a de-facto relationship. A de-facto relationship is someone who is:
  <ul> 
   <li>Not legally married to each other; and<br /> </li> 
   <li>Not related by family; and<br /> </li> 
   <li>Have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.<br /> </li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Receiving independent financial, legal or accounting advice</b> is verbal confirmation a co-borrower makes that they have obtained independent financial, legal or accounting advice to proceed with the loan even though they may not receiving a substantial benefit.</p> 
<p><b>Note: </b>It is your customer's responsibility to interpret their independent financial, legal or accounting advice.<br /> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Substantial Benefit Assessment Guide</b></span></p> 
<p>You must record full comprehensive file notes within the application of each reason&nbsp;and how you determined what benefit each borrower received from the loan.&nbsp;You must make such records accessible for audit if requested by us.</p> 
<p>If there are multiple loan purposes, you must re-repeat the relevant steps for each purpose.</p>
