<p><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Notifications Checklist</span></b></p> 
<p><b>1. Ensure your email address is correct in CommBroker</b></p> 
<p>If you notice your email address is incorrect, &quot;update your details&quot; via CommBroker (link located on the top right hand corner of Commbroker) to reflect the correct address.</p> 
<p><b>2. Are the notifications not being received on all files or is this a one off?</b></p> 
<p>If this is an isolated incident, it may have been a glitch in the system. Monitor the brokers notifications and if there are more notifications missing, complete the additional checks below.</p> 
<p><b>3. Is your mailbox full?</b></p> 
<p>If your mailbox is full you will be unable to receive additional emails. The Unconditional and HomeSeeker notifications contain an attached pdf that may be too large to be received into a full inbox. Please empty your folders of large items.</p> 
<p><b>4. Have these notifications gone to the bulk email folder/spam/junk folder?</b></p> 
<p>As Unconditional and HomeSeeker letters are issued in attachment .pdf format this is a common occurrence. Some mail servers will automatically assume that notifications of this type are to be filtered.</p> 
<p><b>5. Do you have spam filters enabled and are these emails getting caught in the filter?</b></p> 
<p>Double check your spam/junk email filters. If you are using outlook the filter rules can be found in Tools&gt; Options&gt; Preferences&gt; Junk Email. If you are using another email platform, the filter rules can be found generally in the ‘options’ menu. Alternatively please phone your Internet Service Provider.</p> 
<p><b>6. Has orchestrationservices@cba.com.au been blacklisted?</b></p> 
<p>All notifications are sent from this address. If any filters or blocks have been placed on this email address you will not receive notifications. Ensure you are aware of this email address during filter and ISP checks.</p> 
<p><b>7. Have you recently changed your Internet Service Provider (ISP)?</b></p> 
<p>Some ISP’s automatically block automatic emails with attachments. Phone the ISP to double check and ensure all settings are correct.</p> 
<p><b>8. Some Head Aggregators give brokers the option to select which notifications they wish to receive.</b></p> 
<p>If your Aggregator provides this option, contact your Aggregator and check that this option has not been selected for the notifications not being received.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you have checked all of the above and still unable to receive notifications please provide at least two BRN’s as examples confirming what notifications have been missed and email your Relationship Manager with confirmation of the above checks and any outcomes.</p>
