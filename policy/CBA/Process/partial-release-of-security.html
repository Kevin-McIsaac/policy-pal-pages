We are committed to meeting your requested settlement date and if we require any further information to progress your discharge request, we’ll be in touch with you to discuss.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Partial Discharge is where the customer has multiple loans and/or multiple properties and are releasing property but not repaying all loans</li> 
 <li>If the Customer has repaid their Home Loan and requires their Title Deed, they must complete the <a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/digital/home-loan-forms/mortgage-discharge/start" target="_blank" adhocenable="false">online Discharge/Refinance Authority Form</a> and select the&nbsp;Loan repaid option.</li> 
 <li>Once we’ve received your signed request, there’s a number of steps that need to take place to finalise and process your request. We’ll be in touch with you shortly to progress your request. If you need to get in touch with us to discuss your discharge request, please contact us on <b>13 25 88</b> and select option <b>2</b> for Discharges.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Note:</b> When your customer requests a New Home Loan as well as a maintenance request, you must submit the maintenance request to the relevant department simultaneously with your New Home Loan application for simultaneous assessment.</p> 
<p>Where applicable, ensure applications are cross-referenced e.g. new money application, enter comments to cross reference to the Home Loan Maintenance request.<br /> <b>Care:</b> New Home Loan to be assessed in conjunction with Partial Release of Security Maintenance request</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;Valuation Ordering / Financial Information</b></p> 
<p>The following information may be requested and can only be determined once the application has been assessed by Credit Decisioning team:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>The suitability of any new or existing security property may require the Bank to undertake a valuation(s)</li> 
 <li>The Bank may be required to obtain updated financial details.&nbsp;
  <ul> 
   <li>Ensure only sections 2, 8 and 10 of the <a href="http://commnet.cba/tools/eforms/eForm%20Documents/001-126.pdf">Miscellaneous Applications (001-126)</a> are completed, as required; and</li>

  </ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>LMI Cover</b></p> 
<p>All instances of partial discharges, involving existing LMI cover, require approval by Genworth (Mortgage Insurer) with an external valuation where the original valuation is older than 90 days, as the original base LVR must be maintained.</p> 
<p>In these instances the Bank does not hold a Delegated Underwriting Authority (DUA) therefore requires a Genworth assessment and decision every time&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Tracking</b></p> 
<p>You can track the progress of all your Home Loan Maintenance Requests via CommBroker Loan Tracking. Please refer to the <a href="/Net/Documentum/processes/maintenance-processes/maintenance-loan-tracking-process.aspx">Maintenance Loan Tracking</a> page for more information.</p>
