<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gross Rental Income</span></b></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span><b>Definition</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>Gross rental income refers to the amount of rent received by the customer prior to the deduction of real estate agent's commission, other expenses and income tax, etc. Gross rental income only applies to self-contained dwellings. Room rental and board are unacceptable. This includes rental income from NDIS properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>If evidence </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>is held on file and is from different sources at the time of verification of the application (e.g. valuation is held and shows a lower figure than the rental appraisal provided), the lowest amount must be used. This excludes dated information from tax returns.<br/> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span><b>Holiday Rental Income</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>Defined as rental that is either varied or inconsistent in amount and / or regularity i.e. dependent on or determined by the time of year. Example - a holiday unit which would receive 'high' rental income during peak times (Christmas, Easter) but potentially can also receive minimal or no rental income during the quieter periods.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span><b>National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) Income</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>The National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) is a Federal Government initiative aimed at providing more affordable rental accommodation to lower income individuals and families. As a rule NRAS rental income is usually a set figure 20 to 30% below the normal market rental.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>Rental income received under NRAS is treated differently to that of regular gross rental income. The figure is set at the time of the purchase and increases in line with the national average. Subsequently every 3 or so years the property is appraised by an independent valuer to review and resets the rent to the current market.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span><b>Rental Yield</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>Rental Yield is a representation of the total rental income received as a percentage of the Purchase price/Owners estimate of the property.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span><b>Rental Expenses</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>Where a customer receives rental income and this is used for servicing the amount of rental expenses required to maintain the property must also be determined. Refer: <a adhocenable="false" href="/Net/Documentum/credit-policy/verifying-expenditure.aspx">Verifying Transaction Account/s, Account Conduct and Commitments / Expenditure</a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>Rental expenses are not to be included as monthly living expenses and are to be captured at an individual property level.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span><b>Note:</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>The amount of rental income used in servicing will be 90% of the gross rental income less rental expenses.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>The rental expenses applied will be the higher of the customer declared/verified expenses or 10% of the gross rental income amount. This will be automatically calculated by the system.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>Example:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>Gross Rental Income $2000 x 90% (10% shading)  = $1800</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>Less Rental expenses $2000 x 10% or higher of customer declared/verified expenses = minimum $200.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span>$1800 - $200 = $1600 used for servicing.<br/> </span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Ownership can involve properties owned with other individuals or for non-individual properties, the ownership via shareholding should be used to determine total property ownership.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Example:</b> An applicant owns 2 properties in their name solely, one joint with their spouse and one in a non-trading trust name where they have 50% shareholding.
