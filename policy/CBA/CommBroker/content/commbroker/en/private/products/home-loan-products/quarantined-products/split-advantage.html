<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Features and Benefits</b></p> 
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p> 
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>What is Split Addvantage?</b></p> 
<p style="text-align: left;">Split Addvantage works on the basis that the customer has an Equity Advantage facility with:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>an owner occupied Home Loan and</li> 
 <li>a Line of Credit (LOC) taken to purchase an investment property (or other personal investment purposes such as the purchase of shares or managed funds)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>How does Split Addvantage work?</b></p> 
<p>Split Addvantage allows customers to structure the cash flow of their borrowings so that their repayment streams are combined and directed towards the owner occupied Home Loan only until it is repaid. the interest on the LOC is capitalised over this period of time. Once the owner occupied Home Loan is repaid the combined repayments are then directed to repaying the LOC.</p> 
<p>The customer's repayment commitment does not change. They are simply combining the repayments they would have made under the two loan agreements into one. As a result of their owner occupied Home&nbsp;Loan is repaid over a much shorter period. The LOC balance will increase as interest is capitalised.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Note:</b> Whilst the Home Loan is current and Interest and fees are being capitalised to the LOC, the limit on the LOC is <b>NOT</b> to be increased to cover these interest and fee charges. the LOC will operate in excess of the recorded LOC limit but not in excess of the EA limit. The LOC limit will be reviewed and the account placed in reduction when the Home Loan is repaid.</p>
