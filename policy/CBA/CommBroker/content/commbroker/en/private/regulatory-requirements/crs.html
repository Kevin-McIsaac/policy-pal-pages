<h3><span style="font-size: 10pt;">CRS and the Australian Law</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Australian Government has committed to a new global standard on the automatic exchange of financial account information. This is called the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and requires financial institutions (FIs) around the world to collect tax residency information from their customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) is an initiative to prevent taxpayers from avoiding their tax obligations globally. Tax authorities will exchange information reported from FIs to assist in making sure everyone pays the right amount of tax across the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">CRS requires the CBA Group to collect tax residency information and report certain account information to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What you need to know</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">From 1 July 2017, Australian financial institutions need to collect tax residency information and obtain a self-certification from the customer when they open a new account. In order for the Commonwealth Bank Group to be compliant some changes are required to enable staff to capture additional tax residency information when customers open - Transaction, Savings or Investment accounts such as Complete Access and Everyday Offset, or when creating a customer profile for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">CBA Group need to collect the following information from new personal customers, and existing personal customers opening new in-scope accounts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">name of the country(ies) where they have tax residency (including Australia)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">their Tax Identification Number (TIN) for that country, or reason for not being able to provide the TIN</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">customers must then self-certify (confirm) that their information is correct</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For non-personal customers, CBA Group needs to determine whether the entity is a passive non-financial entity (NFE) by asking whether the entity is used primarily for investment purposes: “Is the entity’s primary business activity investing?”.Prompts are provided to help determine whether the entity is ‘active’ (e.g. carries on a trade) or ‘passive’ (i.e. derives its income from investment sources such as dividends or interest).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">CBA Group need to collect the following information from the non-personal customer:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">name of the country(ies) where they have tax residency (including Australia)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">their Tax Identification Number (TIN) for that country, or reason for not being able to provide the TIN</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">customers must then self-certify (confirm) that their information is correct</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In addition, if the entity is a passive NFE, they must also identify the Controlling Person(s) of the passive NFE and obtain the same information and self-certification(s) for each Controlling Person(s), as for the new personal customers above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A CRS account stop will be placed on ‘in-scope’ accounts when tax residency details are incomplete and if self-certification is not provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What you need to do </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You need to collect the tax residency details and self-certification from customers. CBA Group needs to collect this information in order to meet our reporting obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You can also access CRS related information from the <a href="https://business.iorder.com.au/BrowsePublicationDownload.aspx?ProdID=JS37889">ATO website.</a></span></p>
