<p style="text-align: right;"><a adhocenable="false" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(45, 134, 203); text-decoration-line: none; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: right; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><a adhocenable="false" href="/Net/Documentum/regulatory-requirements/default.aspx">Back to Regulatory Requirements</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Act), which incorporates the Australian Privacy Principles, regulates the exchange and use of credit information, and regulates the way private sector organisations handle personal information – that is, how they collect, use, disclose, secure, destroy, correct and provide access to personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To comply with the Act, the Commonwealth Bank (Bank) requires that all applicants read Part A of the "Home Loan Customer Consent Pack" and read and sign Part A of the ‘Home Loan On-Boarding Application’. By signing this form, the applicant authorises the Bank to handle their personal information and undertake certain investigations as part of its consideration of the application (for example, credit reporting agency checks).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Undertaking these investigations without written consent from the customer may expose the Bank to legal liability under the Act. In order to comply with the Privacy Act, you must:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Ensure that customers applying for credit are aware that by signing the Home Loan On-Boarding Application they also consent to credit checks; and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If an applicant queries or objects to the credit checks, explain that by law we need their consent to make certain credit enquiries and without their consent we are unable to consider their application.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please refer to our Privacy Policy at <a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.commbank.com.au/security-privacy/general-security/" target="_blank">https://www.commbank.com.au/security-privacy/general-security</a> &amp; our Credit Reporting Information at <a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.commbank.com.au/security-privacy/general-security/credit-reporting">https://www.commbank.com.au/security-privacy/general-security/credit-reporting</a></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Duty of Confidentiality</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Bank has a strict legal duty of confidentiality in relation to all records and information concerning current and former applicants and/or customers and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Bank and its representatives (which includes Brokers &amp; their staff) must not divulge information concerning an applicant and/or customer's banking arrangements to anyone other than the applicant and/or customer unless the applicant and/or customer authorises release of the information or the Bank is compelled by law to disclose information, such as a court order, and requests from the Australian Taxation Office (<b>ATO</b>) or Australian Securities and Investment Commission (<b>ASIC</b>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A breach of the Bank's Duty of Confidentiality or the requirements of the Privacy Act may result in the Bank being non-compliant with its obligations, and may trigger additional obligations that the Bank must comply with. For example, in certain circumstances, the bank will be required to notify individuals likely to be at risk of serious harm as a result of a data breach relating to their personal information. The Bank would also be required to notify the Regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Any potential, suspected or actual breach of the Duty of Confidentiality and the requirements of the Privacy Act must be reported to the bank immediately, to enable the appropriate steps to be taken in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Any breach is viewed seriously and may result in disciplinary action, including termination and disqualification of any Broker accreditation with the Bank.</span></p>
