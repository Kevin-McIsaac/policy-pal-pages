<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Take care when dealing with customers vulnerable to financial abuse. Financial abuse can take a variety of different forms within different relationships, including intimate partners, family members or carers.<br/>  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>What is financial abuse?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Financial abuse is when a person (it could be a partner, a family member or a friend) improperly controls your decisions, access to your money or property without your consent. Anyone could be subject to financial abuse, vulnerable circumstances, or be taken advantage of. This can affect a customer both financially and psychologically. In order to protect the customer, you should always be proactive in looking for any warning signs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Potential signs of financial abuse</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The following scenarios are common examples where a customer may show signs that they are vulnerable to financial abuse:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Appears to be coerced into applying for a loan by a family member, friend or other person</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Remains silent while another party does all the talking<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Appears withdrawn and fearful (particularly of the person accompanying them)<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Gives implausible explanations or is confused about what they are doing with their money<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Expresses concern about missing funds, or personal or financial documents<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A customer contacts you to discuss risks and their responsibilities of a loan after loan documents have been signed and advises they were coerced into applying for the loan<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">During discussions one borrower advises they are going through a separation with the joint applicant, and doesn’t understand their risk or responsibilities<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A customer who is unaware of the other applicant’s debt level and seems nervous and shocked when this is identified during a loan application<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A customer who speaks no/limited English, is being asked to be a Co-Borrower on a loan and doesn’t understand their risk or responsibilities<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A customer who becomes agitated when you advise that you must speak to all borrowers/account holders<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A customer receives no benefit by being on the loan and is unaware of the risks involved<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A third party is speaking on behalf of another customer who is quiet during the interview<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A customer is confused during the application or does not understand what they are being asked to do<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A customers language/body language changes when not in the company of the Co-Borrower<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A customer has no access to their banking, or their money is controlled by a third party.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Guidelines to identify and assist customers vulnerable to financial abuse.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Follow the procedure below which outlines probing questions and actions to take when you feel that your customer may be vulnerable to financial abuse or being taken advantage of by a third party for financial gain or benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Customer Vulnerability and Financial Abuse e-learning is available</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br/> We have a simple e-learning module that outlines how to better identify and care for customers who are potentially vulnerable or experiencing financial abuse. If you would like to complete this short e-learning module, please email: <a adhocenable="false" href="mailto:thirdpartylearning@cba.com.au" target="_blank">thirdpartylearning@cba.com.au</a><br/> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Process to hide previously issued joint statements</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For any joint Home loan account, statements issued prior to 19th June 2021 will be visible to both borrowers on Netbank and/or the Commbank App.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A customer may request to have their own statements for joint accounts hidden from other account holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If the customer wishes to hide a past statement, please email your Relationship Manager with the subject line “Request for statement to be hidden” and include the below information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Loan account number</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Customer name<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Loan product type<br/> </span></li>
