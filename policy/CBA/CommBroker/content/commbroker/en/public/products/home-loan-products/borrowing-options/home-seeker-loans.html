<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><a href="/Net/Documentum/products/home-loan-products/default.aspx">Back to Home Loan Products</a></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Description</b></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A Home Seeker Loan provides customers with confirmation that they are conditionally eligible for a loan of a certain amount prior to a specific property being found. The Home Seeker letter sets up the pre-approval conditions and includes a snapshot of the loan details. Once a property is located, additional loan types or multiple facilities may be chosen and the Pre-Offer letter will reflect these changes.<br /> </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Features</b></span></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Home Seeker Loan allows customers to look for a suitable property with more confidence.<br /> </span></li> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The loan is 'conditionally pre-approved' and is valid for up to 90 days from the 'conditionally pre-approval' date. 'Conditionally pre-approved' refers to a loan amount being conditionally approved prior to the borrower having an actual property in mind.<br /> </span></li> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You will need to supply full financial verification documents at the initial submission of the Home Seeker application, and will need to re-supply verification documents at the 90 day expiry for reassessment if the borrower has not found a suitable property,<br /> </span></li> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You will also need to make an amendment in ApplyOnline to confirm MLE at the 90 day expiry for re-assessment<br /> </span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Conditions</b></span></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Bank's usual terms and conditions will apply to the loan including the property meeting the Bank's usual security requirements.<br /> </span></li> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Where loan approval is subject to Lenders' Mortgage Insurance (LMI) normal procedure is to be followed.<br /> </span></li> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Interest rates are not guaranteed under the 'conditional pre-approval', i.e. Rate Lock is not available until the application is no longer a Home Seeker and a signed Contract of Sale is received by CommBank. The rate discussed during the Home Seeker application canâ€™t be locked in.</span></li> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Conditional pre-approval will lapse unless a formal application is completed within 90 days.<br /> </span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Note: The Bank may need to review the pre-approval if:</b></span></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The financial information provided by the customer has changed e.g. financial information or security details provided by the customer.<br /> </span></li> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The actual purchase price of the property or the building costs on the property differ from the estimated purchase price or building costs provided by the customer.<br /> </span></li> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The conditional pre-approval expires (which is after 90 days of the conditional pre-approval date), you must get updated financials from your customer, and confirm the loan still meets their needs.<br /> </span></li> 
</ul> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Where property has not been located</b></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Once the applicant's credit worthiness and eligibility have been established, the Bank will establish a Home Seeker loan. The Bank will prepare a Home Seeker loan letter which is to be given to the applicant.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Note:&nbsp;</span></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Once the property is located, confirmation is required from the client that the details in the application have not changed. If details have changed the application needs to be reassessed by the Bank.</span></li> 
 <li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Where the formal loan offer expires after 90 days of the conditional pre-approval date, you will need to obtain from the customer updated financials and confirm that the loan still meets their requirements and supply evidence of this to the Bank. This will include all new proof of income and liabilities (with the exception of annually/one off produced documentation where there has been no change-e.g. self-employed income, court orders-including child maintenance, ATO invoice, HECs, etc).</span></li> 
</ul>
