<p> </p>
<p>Due to the Banking Code of Practice, for joint applications you will now be required to assess whether each borrower is receiving a Substantial Benefit.</p>
<p>Substantial Benefit means an equal or greater interest in the use of the loan funds (e.g. Asset/s purchased, debt refinanced or other acceptable purposes).</p>
<p>See the <a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.commbank.com.au/content/dam/commbank/personal/home-loans/fact-sheets/co-borrower-fact-sheet.pdf?ei=options_co-borrower" target="_blank">Co-Borrower fact sheet</a> for examples of Substantial Benefit </p>
<p>You can include a party as a co-borrower on a Home Loan, Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit application if:</p>
<ul>
<li>They're receiving a substantial benefit; <b>or</b></li>
<li>They're receiving a benefit that may not be a substantial benefit; <b>and</b>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">We have taken reasonable steps to make sure they understand the risks associated with entering into the loan, and understand the difference between being a co-borrower and a guarantor; <b>and</b></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">We have taken into account the reasons why they want to be a co-borrower; <b>and</b></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">We're satisfied that they're not experiencing any financial abuse.</li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note </b>– Acceptable Co-Borrower Reason/s must be determined per loan purpose. For support refer through to the below Substantial Benefit Assessment Guide<br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b style="font-size: 12pt;">Definitions</b></p>
<p><b>Substantial benefit </b>means an equal or greater interest in the use of the loan funds, e.g. assets purchased, debt refinanced or other acceptable loan purposes.</p>
<p>A <b>Spouse </b>is defined as a couple who is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Married or</li>
<li>In a de-facto relationship. A de-facto relationship is someone who is:
  <ul>
<li>Not legally married to each other; and<br/> </li>
<li>Not related by family; and<br/> </li>
<li>Have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.<br/> </li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Receiving independent financial, legal or accounting advice</b> is verbal confirmation a co-borrower makes that they have obtained independent financial, legal or accounting advice to proceed with the loan even though they may not receiving a substantial benefit.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>It is your customer's responsibility to interpret their independent financial, legal or accounting advice.<br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Substantial Benefit Assessment Guide</b></span></p>
<p>You must record full comprehensive file notes within the application of each reason and how you determined what benefit each borrower received from the loan. You must make such records accessible for audit if requested by us.</p>
<p>If there are multiple loan purposes, you must re-repeat the relevant steps for each purpose.</p>
