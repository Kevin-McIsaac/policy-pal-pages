<li>Customer / beneficial owner is provided with the <a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.commbank.com.au/personal/apply-online/download-printed-forms/Certified_Copies_Identification_Form.pdf" target="_blank">Certified Copies of Identification form</a></li>
<li>Customers / beneficial owner arranges for a prescribed person to complete the <a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.commbank.com.au/personal/apply-online/download-printed-forms/Certified_Copies_Identification_Form.pdf" target="_blank">Certified Copies of Identification form</a> and certify copies of the identification documents.
