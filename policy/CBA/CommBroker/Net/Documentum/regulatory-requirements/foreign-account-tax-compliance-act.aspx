<h3><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>US FACTA and the Australian Law</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is the United States (US) government’s framework to prevent US taxpayers from avoiding their US tax obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Australian government has signed an agreement with the US government that requires Australian financial institutions to regularly report on account information held by US persons to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).<br/> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">FATCA requires the CBA Group to identify and report their account holders who are US persons or has US indicia (US address or phone number, or other identifying US information).<br/> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A US person is defined as:<br/> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">An individual who is citizen or<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A tax resident of the US, or<br/> </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Certain types of legal entities that have a controlling person who is a US tax resident.<br/> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b> </b></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>What you need to know</b><br/> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">From 1 July 2014, Australian financial institutions need to capture additional information to identify US persons. In order for the Commonwealth Bank Group to be compliant some minor changes are required to enable staff to capture additional tax residency information when customers open - Transaction, Savings or Investment accounts such as Complete Access and Everyday Offset, or when creating a customer profile for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Initial changes to CBA Group’s systems took effect from 20 June 2014 but the CBA Group’s systems have been further enhanced to collect US tax residency and citizenship details and a self-certification up-front which takes effect from 26 June 2017. From this time Bank staff need to collect the following information from new personal customers, and existing personal customers opening new in-scope accounts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Confirm and capture their US tax residency (all United States citizens and residents must identify themselves as tax residents of the U.S.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If US tax resident obtain their Tax Identification Number (TIN), or reason for not being able to provide the TIN</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">customers must then self-certify (confirm) that their information is correct</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For non-personal customers, the Bank needs to capture the answer to a new question designed to identify if the entity is used primarily for investment purposes. These customers will be asked “Is your entities primary business activity investing?” to determine if the entity is ‘active’ (e.g. carries on a trade) or ‘passive’ (i.e. derives it’s income from investment sources such as dividends or interest). The Bank staff need to collect the following information from non-personal customer:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Confirm and capture the non-person US tax residency</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If non-person US tax resident obtain their Tax Identification Number (TIN), or reason for not being able to provide the TIN</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Confirm and capture the US Tax residency/TIN(s) of Beneficial Owners (all United States citizens and residents must identify themselves as tax residents of the U.S.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">customers must then self-certify (confirm) that their information is correct</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is a change to existing broker application processes to capture tax residency details (including Australia) and the self-certification for the Home Loan submission process and there will be no impact on Credit Decisioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b> </b></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>What you need to do</b><br/> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You need to collect the tax residency details and self-certification from customers. The Bank needs to collect this information in order to meet our reporting obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If a customer contacts you after receiving a request for the additional information then from 1 July 2014 you can direct them to the Bank’s Central FATCA Processing team on 1300 590 330: Monday to Friday 8.15am – 6.00pm AEST.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You can also access FATCA related information from the <a adhocenable="false" href="https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Other-topics/International/Foreign-Account-Tax-Compliance-Act" target="_blank">ATO website.</a></span></p>
