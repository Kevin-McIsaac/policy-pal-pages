<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>The Low Documentation Loan (Low Doc) option is designed for self-employed customers who are unable to provide the usual up-to-date income verification documents (ie. financial statements, Notice of Assessments etc).</p>
<p>A self-employed customer is deemed to be someone who earns their income as a sole trader, in partnership or as the principal of a company in Australia. They generally do not receive after tax pay at a regular interval during the year, instead they earn gross (before tax) income and pay out expenses during the year.</p>
