<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When the loan purpose is to consolidate or refinance any CommBank or Other Financial Institution (OFI) Home/Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit, you must have a conversation with the customer to ensure they are aware of the costs and product features they will have with the proposed new Home/Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit compared to the product they are repaying or refinancing. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The impact of the home loan on the customer's repayments (monthly and total) and loan term.</li>
<li>If the Home/Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit  interest rate / fees are better or worse than on the loan(s) being consolidated or refinanced (including taking into account early repayment, exit fees or break costs)</li>
<li>Differences in product features and benefits.</li>
<li>The convenience of consolidating finances with one financial institution.</li>
<li>Access to customer service offerings from CommBank.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must understand the customer's requirements and objectives and whether these are met by consolidating their debt / refinancing to a CommBank home loan.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Conversation Guide</h3>
<p>Ask the customer for the following information about their existing Home/Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current interest rate and any fees and charges.</li>
<li><b>C</b>urrent repayment amounts</li>
<li>Remaining loan term, if applicable.</li>
<li>Any early repayment/break/exit fees that may apply</li>
<li>Any special features of the product.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Discuss the features of the customer’s existing Home/Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit and compare with the proposed new CommBank Home/Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit to identify benefits of the refinance. These may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower repayment amounts</li>
<li>Shorter loan term</li>
<li>Lower interest rate / fees / charges</li>
<li>Better product features, e.g. Redraw</li>
<li>More convenience by consolidating with one financial institution</li>
<li>Access to customer service offerings from CommBank</li>
</ul>
<p>If the customer wants to proceed with the refinancing of their existing Home/Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit, check if the customer is eligible for FASTRefi®. Refer to the <a adhocenable="false" href="/Net/Documentum/processes/new-applications/fast-refi-p1t0.aspx" target="_blank">FASTRefi®</a> page for more information.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You must establish that the new Home/Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit would better meet the customer's requirements and objectives by discussing the comparison of their existing Home/Investment Home Loan or Line of Credit with the proposed new home loan arrangement. Where the new home loan has disadvantages, discuss with the customer whether those disadvantages are outweighed by the benefits. You must establish the consolidation/refinance results either in overall cost savings to the customer or, if that is not the case, that the consolidation/refinance better meets the customer’s requirements and objectives (e.g. because of convenience, greater flexibility or particular tailored features such as a redraw facility on a mortgage).</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">If the customer has...</th>
<th scope="col">Then... </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A lower interest rate on their existing lending facilities than the new proposed  home loan (excluding any discounts such as package)</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Advise the customer that their overall cost of financing will potentially increase under the new arrangement.</li>
<li>Ask the customer what the reason is for them wanting to consolidate their debt / refinance to a CommBank home loan.</li>
</ul> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A shorter loan term remaining on their existing lending facilities</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the customer is aware that spreading their repayments over a longer term means that they may end up paying more overall, even if the interest rate on the new loan may be lower.</li>
<li>Ask the customer what the reason is for them wanting to consolidate their debt / refinance to a CommBank home loan.</li>
</ul> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>An existing lending facility that the customer is having difficulty paying but you reasonably believe that refinancing will not improve their situation</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Advise the customer we are unable to assist. If the customer has indicated they are having trouble paying a CommBank facility, this constitutes a hardship application and you must refer the customer to our Financial Assistance Solutions team in accordance with our usual hardship procedures. If it is an OFI debt, you should suggest they consider making a hardship application with the OFI.</li>
</ul> </td>
