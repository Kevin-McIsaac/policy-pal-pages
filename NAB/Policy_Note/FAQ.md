# Will NAB allow casual income for people employed for less that 6 month?
Yes. However the [Casual Income Policy](https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/NAB/income.html) requires the use of the average of the payments received for a minimum of the most recent 180-day period (including allowances/penalty rates e.g. double time/time and a half etc)
