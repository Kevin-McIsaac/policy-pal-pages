Here you will find answers to frequently asked questions 
that can help you get the most out of Policy Pal

## I did not get the answer I expected?
There can be several reason for this and here are the 
things you should try first.
1. Read the answer carefully then think of a another
way to ask the question. 
   * Did you use the right terminology? You can try asking 
   Policy Pal a broader question based on what you are trying to do?
   * Are there assumptions that need to be made explicit in the 
   question, e.g., lenght of employment in the industry?
   * Did you provide the necessary facts about the customer?
2. Review the documents Policy Pal found that are related to the 
question. 
   * Is there a missing document? Report a bug providing the details of 
   the question and informaton on where to find the missing policy documents.
   * Did it find the right documents but interpret the policy incorrectly. Report 
   a bug with the details of the question and what is wrong with the answer.
