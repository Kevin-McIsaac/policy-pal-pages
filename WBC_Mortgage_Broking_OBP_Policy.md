 </h4>
 <span>
  <span>
   The Westpac Bank Group prefers to be the only mortgagee on a security property.  There may be some instances where we may take a second mortgage, for example, where the second mortgage is covering a shortfall in security by the primary property (e.g. Family Security Guarantee loan option).
   <br/>
  </span>
 </span>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   <span>
    A second mortgage may be taken to cover a shortfall of security including a guarantee where the Primary security is being taken by / or is already held with Westpac Bank Group registered as the 1
    <sup>
     st
    </sup>
    mortgagee.
   </span>
  </span>
 </span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   The below scenarios are excluded:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If the existing 1
   <sup>
    st
   </sup>
   mortgage is for a reverse mortgage styled facility
  </li>
  <li>
   The 1
   <sup>
    st
   </sup>
   mortgagee is not a Financial institution, i.e. is a private mortgage provider. Private mortgage providers include but are not limited to an individual, a solicitor, vendor finance.
  </li>
  <li>
   LMI applies to the proposed loan and the first mortgage is not held by Westpac Bank
  </li>
 </ul>
 <strong>
  <span>
   <span>
    Note

  </span>
 </strong>
 <span>
  <span>
   :
   <br/>
   SGB, BSA, BoM and RAMS are considered to be other external providers/other financial institutions.
  </span>
 </span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   Brokers should advise the applicant(s) that second mortgage scenarios may lead to longer settlement time frames that are outside of Westpac Bank Group's control.  Delays can occur when we write to the prior mortgagee seeking consent to register the second mortgage and we ask the prior mortgagee to establish their priority amount.

      </span>
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <span>
      <span>
       In all other cases the land may have no stand-alone value and cannot be taken as security due to the following risks:
      </span>
     </span>
     <ul>
      <li>
       The purchaser may be required to enter into a building contract that will have common areas, party walls or common building foundations with other properties (i.e. a common builder is completing all dwellings and common property in the development)
      </li>
      <li>
       The land is not a saleable security. This could be for various reasons including the common property (roadways and access) have not been completed at the time of settlement; the land contract prohibits sale or transfer; there is no secondary market for the land due to size, access, restrictive covenants etc.
      </li>
      <li>
       When common property is involved (common roadways, common access ways and in particular common walls / slab) if the developer or builder ceases operation, Westpac Group will need to jointly engage with the remaining owners and financiers to complete the development. This is not an acceptable situation.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <span>
      <strong>
       <span>
        Note:
       </span>
      </strong>
     </span>
     <span>
      0% LVR applies during the construction period
     </span>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Once these developments are fully complete, able to be occupied and individual titles issued, Westpac Group may accept these as security, as they would be considered readily saleable as a 'normal' house / townhouse / strata unit.

 <span>

   Third party security collateral is when the Bank is offered security collateral from a person/s that is
   <strong>
    <span>
     not
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
  identical to the borrower. For example:
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The borrower is a company and security collateral is offered by the company directors
  </li>
  <li>
   The security collateral is owned by two people and is offered as security for a loan for only one of those two people.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   The bank does
   <strong>
    <span>
     not
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
  take a third party mortgage, but takes:
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A first party mortgage from all mortgagors, and
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   A guarantee from the mortgagors who are not borrowers. Under no circumstance is a third party security collateral to be taken without a supporting guarantee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Third party security must also comply with

   NRAS is a government backed incentive scheme that seeks to address the shortage of affordable rental housing by offering financial incentives to build and rent dwellings to low and moderate income households at lower levels compared to market rates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are two distinct NRAS structures:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Head leases
  </li>
  <li>
   Non-entity joint ventures (NEJV)
  </li>

         When assessing the residential full valuation there will be two values listed in the valuation:

   Individual owners have been written to by the ACT Government outlining a government buy back offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This is due to ongoing public health and safety risks posed by the continuing presence of loose fill asbestos insulation in Canberra homes. Participation in the Buyback Program is voluntary and eligible home owners must lodge an application directly with the ACT Government taskforce by
   <strong>
    <span>
     Tuesday, 30 June 2015
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
 </span>
 <span>
  <span>
   .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If the owners take up the ACT Government offer, the intent is to demolish dwellings and remove the contamination then return the previously affected blocks back to the market for resale, with former owners (shown as at Tuesday, 28 October 2014 as the offer is not transferable), having a first right of refusal to purchase the affected block (at full market value, to be determined at the time of purchase) after it is remediated. Owners will be compensated by way of the ACT Government engaging two API accredited valuers to determine a market value of the property as if it were not affected by the loose fill asbestos, in order to establish the amount to be paid as 'buy back'.
   <br/>

   For the security to be acceptable the following conditions must be met:

 <ul>
  <li>
   There is no current market for the sale and purchase of affected homes and therefore affected properties have a nil lending value until the ACT Government offer is made and accepted by the owners (as shown as at 28/10/14).
  </li>
  <li>
   Only the ACT Government agreed security value is to be used as the security assessment. No other security assessment is to be relied on.
  </li>
  <li>
   A copy of the ACT Government offer must be held as the security assessment.
  </li>
  <li>
   Proof the ACT Government offer has been accepted by the customer must be held prior to full approval.
  </li>
  <li>
   All Government conditions must be met e.g. customer can only be the registered owner as at 28/10/2014 as the offer is not transferable.

   <strong>
    <span>
     Option 1

   b) Under
  </span>
  <strong>
   <span>
    Option 2
   </span>
  </strong>
 </span>
 <span>
  , homeowners will be offered the value of the whole property minus the value of the land. For rural properties, homeowners will be offered the value of the affected premises and any building or structures on its curtilage. The curtilage is the area, usually enclosed, that encompasses the grounds and buildings immediately surrounding the premises that are used in daily domestic activities. The effect of this process is that homeowners are offered the value of the affected premises by itself.

 </span>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   Participation in the H4H scheme is voluntary for our customers and they can opt-out at any time. The scheme has been rolled out to all states in Australia. To facilitate this process, the owners execute a Deed of Donation with Homes for Homes who lodge a permissive caveat on the title. To register a Transfer of Ownership or Mortgage, consent from Homes for Homes will be required to be provided to the LTO with our settlement documents for lodgement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The type of consent required by the LTO to accept the lodgement of our documents is specific to each state. To assist team members with understanding what information is required at settlement, a state based requirements matrix has been created.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Where our customer does not wish to donate, they can request the Withdrawal of Caveat from the charity, which will need to be provided at settlement if the customer would like the bank to lodge it as part of our lodgement documents.

 </span>
 <br/>
 <span>
  Brokers are to advise the customer to contact Homes for Homes and request the documents required as outlined in Homes for Homes Matrix. The originals or a copy of the documents are to be provided to Home Ownership Services prior to settlement.

     1.2 What is LVR?
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <span>
  <span>
   LVR is a term used to express the percentage ratio of a loan to the value of an asset or assets that provide security collateral for a loan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank uses LVR to:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Assign a maximum percentage we will lend against security property offered, with or without mortgage insurance
  </li>
  <li>
   Show the amount of lending (expressed as a percentage ratio) a customer may already have against a collateral
  </li>
  <li>
   Identify when Lender’s Mortgage (LMI) is required
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   By using the assigned LVRs in this policy and the
   <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000686">
    <em>
     <span>
      security collateral value
     </span>
    </em>
   </a>
  </span>
  of the property, we can determine the
  <em>
   <span>
    lending value
   </span>
  </em>
 </span>
 <span>
  <span>
   of the offered security collateral.
   <br/>
   <br/>

 </h3>
 <span>
  <span>
   The maximum base LVR assigned to a loan is determined by a number of risk characteristics of the application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    <span>
     Based on the risk characteristics, a lower LVR threshold will override the maximum base LVR for owner-occupied and investment security detailed below.

 Where there are two or more applicants (borrower or income guarantor) included on the loan application, the most conservative policy must be applied regardless of their contribution to the loan, for example:

 An Australian citizen who is married to a permanent resident visa holder, living in Australia and earning foreign income, will be restricted to a maximum LVR of 70%, and all policies applicable to the permanent resident visa holder applicant, will apply.

     For the external debt refinance, a max base LVR 90% applies, using the land (plus any existing retained improvements, where applicable e.g. shed, pool) value.
     <br/>
     Brokers must complete a manual calculation to ensure base LVR will not be exceeded when the funds are released for the refinance.
     <br/>
     <span>
      <span>
       <span>
        The total (external refinance plus new construction) max base LVR is then determined using the ‘on completion’ valuation figure

   The bank takes a second mortgage over a security property, where there is a prior mortgagee (e.g. where the first mortgage is held by another financial institution).

   <br/>
   STG, BSA, BoM and RAMS are considered to be other financial institutions.
   <br/>

   Debt allocation may be required when assessing a loan application (new origination or variation) where the borrower:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     Has an existing debt secured by two or more properties and the existing debt is not being refinanced (either partially or in full),

  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      <span>

        Not all properties securing the existing debt will be used as security collateral in the new loan.

      </span>
     </span>
    </span>

  Note:
 </b>
 Debt allocation is not required where all the security collateral properties for the existing debt, are being offered as security collateral for the new loan origination or variation.
 <br/>
 <b>
 </b>
 <br/>
 <b>
  The following debt allocation principles apply:
 </b>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     For properties offered as security collateral on the new loan, the market value from an existing acceptable valuation (where applicable) or new valuation, is the market value used in the new loan application

  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      <span>
       <span>
        Where a property is not being used as security collateral for the new loan but will remain a security collateral for an existing debt, it is shown as an asset property in the new loan application. The value of the asset property entered will be the market value from an existing valuation where it is acceptable to be re-used, or a new valuation (where the existing valuation cannot be re-used), refer

 <span>
  <span>
   Market value for real estate is defined as:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   ‘The estimated amount which a seller would expect to receive from an informed purchaser for the property in the current resale market with normal marketing support through an Australian based real estate agency. The market value is determined on a vacant possession basis and must exclude purchase incentives, non-fixed chattels, legal / stamp duty costs and rental guarantees.’

  <span>
   A market value assessed on this basis will
   <strong>
    <span>
     not

 <span>
  <span>
   The bank accepts the following real estate valuation methods and will apply the below hierarchy where multiple valuations are held within the acceptable age limit:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Residential  &amp; Construction Long Form valuation
  </li>
  <li>
   Residential &amp; Construction Short Form valuation

 </ol>

     2.1 Customer estimated market value
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
 </h3>
 The customer estimated market value is the estimated dollar value the customer provides us of their residential real estate property.
 <br/>
 During the R&amp;O conversation a discussion would be had with the customer about the amount of funding they require and what the funds would be used for. It is reasonable to assume the customer estimate value of their property is sufficient to meet their needs in line with the R&amp;O.
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   The customer estimated market value is not to be amended within an application once a valuation (any type) has been completed.

   All valuation reports remain the property of the Bank and should not be offered to the customer. Reports are prepared for and addressed to the Bank for residential mortgage lending purposes.

 If a customer requires a copy of the bank valuation to support their application for a grant, the customer is to complete the ‘ Customer declaration and acknowledgement ’ form and only on receipt of the signed form can the valuation be provided to the customer.

   In situations where more than 1 market value is available on the one valuation report, use the lower of the values except where:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Credit (or other Credit Risk authorised staff) have approved using a higher value, or
  </li>
  <li>
   Where the below applies
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   Where the security collateral is subject to a Defence Housing Authority (DHA) sale and leaseback arrangement, the panel valuer's valuation report will contain 2 property values. The lower figure represents the vacant possession value. The higher figure is the vacant possession value plus the worth of the government rental guarantee. Where the loan is mortgage insured or requires a valuation, then the higher figure is acceptable if:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The rental guarantee assessment is
   <strong>
    <span>
     not
    </span>
   </strong>
   greater than 110% of the vacant possession assessment
  </li>
  <li>
   The loan is amortising
  </li>
  <li>
   The lease has 6 or more years to run excluding options to renew. Where the loan is
   <strong>
    <span>
     not
    </span>
   </strong>
   subject to mortgage insurance or the LVR ≤ 80%, then the higher valuation figure is acceptable.

 An Automated Valuation Model (AVM) is an electronic valuation that is completed based on recent property sales in the area. They are also known as Modelled Estimate, Electronic Assessment or E-Vals. An AVM is a brief report that indicates the amount the property is worth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Where an AVM search on a security collateral property is successful, it is used to validate the purchase price (COS)
 <b>
  or
 </b>
 the customer estimated market value. The validation is restricted to:
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      <span>
       the specific customer the AVM was ordered for, and
      </span>
     </span>

   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      <span>
       only being used where the LVR for the loan (i.e. the LVR inclusive of all security values) is
       <strong>
        <span>
         equal to or less than
        </span>
       </strong>
       the
       <strong>
        <span>
         maximum end LVR
        </span>
       </strong>
       (i.e. capitalised LVR) value returned with the search.
      </span>
     </span>
    </span>
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   <span>
    Where an AVM for a security collateral in the loan returns a maximum end LVR result that is less than the LVR for the loan, then the security collateral will require an alternate valuation method (either a Desktop if policy permits, or a full valuation).

       There may be circumstances in which the valuation of a property is significantly less than the stated purchase price.
       <br/>

     1.2 Why this policy
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
 </h3>
 <span>
  <span>
   This policy will help you in verifying existing commitments and repayment conduct.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This is a key part of the unsuitability assessment and is required for every applicant who is either a borrower or income-reliant guarantor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Verification of the applicant's commitments ensures accurate information is used in completing a financial assessment and serviceability calculation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Repayment history on existing debts is considered to be a critical indicator of an applicant's credit worthiness and ability to meet commitments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This policy is applicable where the loan activity is a:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   New loan application
  </li>
  <li>
   Loan increase
  </li>
  <li>
   Any servicing (variation) activity requiring a serviceability assessment
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>

     Where a borrower is experiencing difficulty paying their current commitments, they may enter into formal financial hardship arrangements with a credit or finance provider.  Poor conduct may occur even where such arrangements are in place.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Identifying and reviewing performance of formal financial hardship arrangements applies to active commitments held by borrowers and / or income guarantors (WBC only) which are listed on the CCR bureau report.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You are required to manually obtain and review the PDF version of the CCR bureau report to identify if the customer is specifically in temporary relief or has a deferral financial hardship arrangement in place
     <b>
      and
     </b>
     they are operating within the agreed arrangements.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This check is not required where policy does not require a CCR to be generated. E.g. for a Servicing (Variation) activity where no CCR is required to be generated.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ‘financial hardship arrangement check’ policy applies to commitments held with both the Westpac Group or external

       No, you may use a combination of documents, provided the documents or systems used fulfil the policy requirements.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For example, if policy requires that you verify :
       <br/>
       1) Loan Limit:
       <br/>
       2) Loan Interest Rate
       <br/>
       3) Loan Balance
       <br/>
       4) Repayment history
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If the Comprehensive Credit Report (CCR) provides the limit and repayment history only, a second document will be required to confirm the interest rate and the balance.  If the information you need (2 and 3) is contained on an 'account summary/extract/overview' (or any other allowable document), policy has been satisfied and an account statement (or any other document) is not required

    </td>
    <td>

      <span>
       As an example this could occur where:
      </span>
     </span>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        <span>

      </li>
      <li>
       <span>

        </span>
       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <span>

       The customer advised me that the card was closed prior to this loan application. The Comprehensive Credit Bureau Report (CCR) does not display the card as active, and I can't see any payments being made to the card after this loan application.

       The customer has confirmed that the commitment was not in place at the time of the loan application and there is nothing to indicate a conflict with this information. As such, you may accept the customer's explanation and do not need to obtain evidence of closure.

    <td valign="top">
     A construction loan, also known as a building loan or a TBE (To-Be-Erected) loan, is a specialised lending option that provides a borrower and their builder, funding throughout the process of constructing or renovating a property.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This policy identifies the structure required for a home loan where the borrowers would like to use the funds for residential building purposes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The loan proceeds can be used to fund the construction of one or more residential dwellings (subject to

     ) or undertake home improvements (renovations) to an already established property, where the property is also security for the proposed loan.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The main feature is the loan proceeds are paid in progressive payments to the builder during the construction phase. The frequency and percentage / amount of the progress payment being advanced can be affected by the type of security property and nature of the building contract.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The construction can be completed by way of a Licensed Builder or an Owner Builder.

     Cost plus contracts can be identified because they do not state the total cost of the build and may only provide a 'budgeted cost to complete', 'Cost plus a percentage' or may show the cost of the works plus allow a margin for labour or even building material cost increases.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The amount due to the builder is the actual cost incurred by the contractor plus a percentage or the cost incurred plus an hourly rate for the contractor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As materials are not a fixed price, the overall cost of the contract can vary. This can result in a significant increase in the contract price prior to/or during construction and therefore may adversely affect the Bank's lending and security position.

 <span>
  <span>
   <span>
    A Licensed Builder's fixed price contract may incorporate the completion of all required building work. However, it is acceptable for the applicant to provide separate contracts or quotes for additional work to be completed as a part of the loan application.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If these works are being funded by the Bank and the valuer has considered these improvements when arriving at a 'TBE' (To Be Erected) valuation figure of the property, the Bank must control funds to ensure this work is completed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The following items are examples of additional works which may be completed by an external contractor other than the primary builder:
   </span>
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Air conditioning
  </li>
  <li>
   Carpets

     <br/>
     For all Acceptable Building Types, the Valuer at their discretion may request a QS report.
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Note: when the valuer has requested a QS report, this cannot be waived.
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Common instances when this may occur include (but are not limited to):
     <ul>
      <li>
       Owner builder constructions
      </li>
      <li>
       Building sites with complexities (e.g., site access complication, steeply sloping environmental issues / flooding).
      </li>
      <li>
       High build cost per square metre
      </li>
      <li>
       Building contracts with non-industry standard progress schedules e.g.
       <ul>
        <li>
         A progress schedule that is time based (e.g., monthly payments to the builder that do not relate to work completed)
        </li>
        <li>
         A progress schedule that requires payments to be paid, for partially completed works / stages.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>

  <span>
   <span>
    When dealing with Customer and Rental Support Agreement (CARS), these types of agreements are acceptable provided the following is held and verified by Mortgage Operations Progress Draws prior to payment:
   </span>
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   CARS agreement signed by the customer and agent.
  </li>
  <li>
   If the authorised agent in Australia is a company, a Power of Attorney from the company authorising a specific individual from the company to sign the building contract.
  </li>
  <li>
   The individual from the company must provide a statutory Declaration confirming name, employee of the agent and signature.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   <span>
    Note, only the building contract signed under a CARS agreement is acceptable. Progress draw claims signed under a CARS agreement are not acceptable and must be signed by the customer.

 Where policy requires the verification document to include both the account holder name and account number / identifier, and the primary document does not display both, then a second verification document is required to link the primary document to the applicant. The maximum age of the ‘linking’ document is 12 months from the Responsible Lending start date.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Examples of acceptable document combinations include, but are not limited to the following:
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      <b>
       Commitment verification
      </b>
      – a transaction summary is provided which displays the account number but not the account holder’s name.  If used in isolation, the transaction summary does not meet document standards. A second supporting document, such as an account statement (that may not meet the maximum age of document requirements for that document) may be obtained to connect the transaction summary to the applicant.
     </span>
    </span>
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>

       <span>
        <b>
         Income verification
        </b>
        – a payslip does not detail the period the payslip covers, however an internal system extract confirms the applicant is paid weekly. The internal system extract can be used as the second supporting document.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </span>
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 Where the combination of documents supplied do not include all of the mandatory information required to enable the verification activity to be completed, lenders / assessors must obtain an alternate acceptable document.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If no other acceptable document is available , the broker / assessor may refer the application to Credit for consideration, where supported by strong mitigants and justification within application comments.

    The loan purpose indicates the reason why a borrower is applying for a loan. The purpose of the loan is used to make a decision on the borrower’s suitability, eligibility, the risk associated with the transaction as well as setting the appropriate pricing for the loan.

 <span>
  <span>
   <span>
    Note loan purpose and borrower type also determines whether the National Credit Code (NCC) applies.

   <span>
    When interviewing a customer or processing a consumer mortgage loan application, you must take extra care:
   </span>
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you notice a vulnerability
  </li>
  <li>
   if a vulnerability is disclosed to your
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   <span>
    Customer vulnerability refers to customers in circumstances which make them more susceptible to harm, loss, or disadvantage (either personal or financial) than a person not in those circumstances. This means that they may require extra care to help them achieve a similar service outcome to someone who is not in vulnerable circumstances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>
     <span>
      Vulnerable customers include those experiencing:
     </span>
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </span>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   A. Age-related impairment.
   <br/>
   B. Cognitive impairment.
   <br/>
   C. Elder abuse.
   <br/>
   D. Family or domestic violence.
   <br/>
   E. Financial abuse.
   <br/>
   F. Mental illness or mental health problems.
   <br/>
   G. Serious illness and severe or long-term illness.
   <br/>
   H. Gambling
   <br/>
   I. Scams
   <br/>
   J. any other identifiable personal, or financial, circumstance causing significant detriment
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are many types of vulnerability and learning a catalogue of circumstances may not always be helpful. Be alert to recognise the potential signs of someone experiencing vulnerable circumstances and use the extra care mindset:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Act with Sensitivity
  </li>
  <li>
   Act with Compassion
  </li>
  <li>
   Act with Respect
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   <span>
    It is with that extra care mindset, that   Brokers are to ensure all borrowers and guarantors fully understand the commitment they are entering into.

    A substantial benefit requires that each co-borrower must get a real and tangible benefit arising out of the underlying transaction. That is, where there are 2 or more co-borrowers:
   </span>
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      <span>
       Each co-borrower has a direct legal or equitable ownership interest of at least 30%
       <sup>
        *
       </sup>
       in the asset (i.e. property) being purchased with the loan funds, or
      </span>

    </span>
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      <span>
       At least 30%
       <sup>
        *
       </sup>
       of the loan funds will be used to repay or refinance debts or other obligations in each co-borrower’s name.
      </span>
     </span>
    </span>
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   <span>
    <sup>
     *
    </sup>
    If there are more than two co-borrowers, or the co-borrowers have different levels of ownership, then the percentage figure may be reasonably adjusted. For example, 4 co-borrowers could be 25% each. If the minimum percentage is not met, consider whether the applicant who is not receiving a substantial benefit from the loan is better protected under a guarantor structure.

 </h3>
 The National Credit Code (NCC) and the Banking Code of Practice (BCoP) provide protections to individuals who enter into a guarantee as security for a loan.
 <br/>
 For details of the Banking Code of Practice requirements relating to Guarantees, refer to:

    In all instances, prospective guarantors are to be informed that they need to make any appropriate enquiries about the credit worthiness, financial position and integrity of the borrowers. This should be pointed out at application and again at approval. (The prospective guarantors are reminded of this prior to signing the Guarantee and Indemnity.)

       and define the acceptable guarantee types and acceptable guarantors. Acceptability is also subject to:

     Westpac Group is required to demonstrate that the guarantor made a fully informed decision and will receive a measurable benefit that is comparable to the risk they are taking on. A financial benefit is the easiest to define and measure (e.g. the guarantor living in the property they are guaranteeing free of rent).

     Non-financial benefit is more difficult to measure and is, therefore, unlikely to be approved where the relationship is something other than a parent guaranteeing a loan for their children or a Shared Equity Guarantee.

            Confirm with the guarantor the total amount of any existing debts that may be secured by the guarantee property. The guarantor may need to consider not only the current balance of the primary loan they have outstanding, but any available redraw / unused credit limits, any prior guarantees issued to other family members, business overdrafts or investment loans which may have been supported (cross-collateralised) against the guarantors security property.

    Under NCC a guarantee can secure an amount that does not exceed the sum of the borrower’s liabilities, plus reasonable expenses of enforcing the guarantee, or any lesser amount agreed between us and the guarantor. BCoP also requires a guarantee to limit the guarantor’s liability.

   The LVR calculation allows us to determine whether the loan requires mortgage insurance.

        <span>
         Loans that involve individuals providing a guarantee type of ‘Family-Security Guarantee’, 'Shared Equity Guarantee', ‘Spousal-Security Guarantee’ or ‘Spousal-Income + Security Guarantee’ are conditional on the guarantors obtaining independent legal advice and the Bank requires evidence that legal advice has been obtained.

  </li>
  <li>
   The solicitor is not being a solicitor for any other interested party who might have previously given security. An example of an interested party is a guarantor who, having previously provided security, stands to benefit by way of reduced liability, from any additional security given by other guarantors.

  <li>
   The solicitor is not to be a partner of any solicitor who acts for the borrower or other interested party.

      2.6.3.1 Determining undue influence on the guarantor
     </span>
    </span>
   </span>
  </strong>
 </h4>
 <span>
  <span>
   If the Bank knows, or suspects, the guarantee relationship is one of dependency, reliance, or dominance, you must insist on independent legal advice and a solicitor’s certificate. Otherwise, the courts might presume that there was undue influence and set aside the guarantee.
  </span>
 </span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   To help to determine whether there is undue influence, consider the following questions:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Might anyone, in addition to the borrower, benefit from the guarantee being given?
  </li>
 </ol>
 <span>
  <span>
   This could include:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Other individuals who have already given, or are about to give, guarantees (e.g. husband and wife)
  </li>
  <li>
   If the borrower is a trust, a beneficiary of the trust, or
  </li>
  <li>
   Anybody else who has a significant direct or indirect interest in the borrower (e.g. shareholder)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ol>
  <li value="2">
   What is the nature of the relationship between the guarantor and any other benefited person?
  </li>
 </ol>
 <span>
  <span>
   With some relationships there is a presumption of undue influence no matter (e.g. solicitor and client; parent and dependent child; trustee and beneficiary; priest and parishioner; doctor and patient). With others it depends on individual circumstances.
  </span>
 </span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   Where a spouse is providing a guarantee, it is strongly recommended to insist on a solicitor's certificate except where it is clear that the spouse is:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Financially sophisticated
  </li>
  <li>
   Aware of the borrower's position
  </li>
  <li>
   Obtaining some benefit from the transaction.

   The ‘Financial Support Acknowledgement and Undertaking’ must be signed by the guarantor for the below guarantee types:

   Once the guarantor has been provided with:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The terms and conditions of the guarantee
  </li>
  <li>
   Any notice of demand the Bank has made on the borrower in the past two years
  </li>
  <li>
   A copy of the borrower’s loan contract
  </li>
  <li>
   A copy of the borrower’s credit report
  </li>
  <li>
   A copy of the borrower’s financial accounts or statements held in the last two years for the guaranteed loan.
  </li>
  <li>
   A copy of any other information the guarantor reasonably requests about the guaranteed loan
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   Then the guarantor has a minimum of three days to consider the guarantee they are about to provide. We must not accept the signed and returned guarantee document until after the third day.
  </span>
 </span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   The only exceptions we will consider and allow the guarantee to be accepted prior to three days are as follows:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If the guarantor has obtained independent legal advice and provided evidence
  </li>
  <li>
   If the guarantor is acting as trustee for a trust on the loan application.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   Note: accepting the guarantee document back from the guarantor is different to requiring independent legal advice. All requirements of this policy must be met.

     1. Clarify the conflicts with the applicant(s). You may be required to obtain additional supporting documents to verify the commitment.

     2. Amend or update the application to reflect the information found. Re-complete assessments and re-run credit decision if required. If serviceability is still met, continue with application processing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     3. Where serviceability is not met with the updated information, then clarify any conflicts with the applicant(s) and either further update
     <b>
      or
     </b>
     withdraw the application.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     4. Enter application comments detailing any amendments made to the application and / or the outcome of all related customer discussions. This will provide an audit trail and prevent rework.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     5. Enter a final comment in the application confirming the account review activity has been completed

   Is this loan in a Company Name? (If
   <strong>

  </li>
  <li>
   Will another property be the principal place of residence?

  <li>
   Are the loan funds to be used for any business purposes and / or investment purposes other than investment in residential property?

   2.2 Reducing living expenses
  </strong>
 </h3>
 We acknowledge that a customer may change their spending behaviour when they have a new mortgage repayment obligation or following a change in circumstances (e.g. children moving out of parent's house).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 We accept that such a change often involves a reduction in discretionary (non-essential) expenses such as recreation, entertainment, clothing, personal care and groceries. It is less likely that a customer can easily reduce expenses that are more stable by nature such as insurances, property-related costs, utilities, education and telephone. Refer to Expense category tables

 to identify discretionary v’s non-discretionary expense types.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Where the customer has told us that they are prepared to reasonably change their lifestyle to reduce living expenses, we may adjust customer declared expense amounts in the loan assessment system provided:
 <ul>
  <li>
   Broker has had a robust discussion with customer around their living expenses patterns;
   <strong>
    and
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   The reduction appears reasonable;
   <strong>
    and
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   Overall comments are recorded in ApplyOnline detailing:
   <ul>
    <li>
     the customer discussion
    </li>
    <li>
     what expenses have been adjusted and by how much
    </li>
    <li>
     the reasons why the reductions were deemed acceptable by the Broker.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 The customer declared amount cannot be accepted for any outgoing child support, alimony, rent / board (post settlement). The amount of the payment must be verified, for further information refer to

   A dependant is defined as:

 <ul>
  <li>
   a child under the age of 18 years; or
  </li>
  <li>
   a child aged 18 years or older who lives with the applicant, receives no income from government benefits, employment or other income sources, and is totally financially reliant on the applicant (e.g. A full time unemployed student, or a child with a disability living at home permanently)
  </li>
 </ul>

   where the applicant has legal responsibility for the care and welfare of the child, on either a full or part time basis.
   <strong>
    Note:
   </strong>
   The child under the age of 18 years may or may not reside with the applicant.

 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   Any additional expenses for children over the age of 18 living at home need to be captured in the living expenses discussion with the customer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If applicants are expecting to add to their family, this should be identified during completion of Responsible Lending requirements by way of question: Do you expect any significant changes to your financial situation over the next 3 years that would adversely impact your ability to meet your repayments?  Refer to

   Where the child does not reside with the applicant it is acceptable to use an outgoing child support payment in place of including the child as a dependant for serviceability purposes. If no child support is paid or child support is paid and the child resides with the applicant the child must be included as a dependant for serviceability purposes.

  When rental income used in the serviceability assessment is rental income (in AUD) From a property rented on a short term basis and this property was rented for the full 52 weeks of the year.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <span>
  Where the short-term rental property has not been rented for the full 52 weeks of the year, expenses incurred when the property is not rented are to be entered into customer expenses either as an owner occupied primary or owner-occupied secondary expenses. The lender should discuss with the customer to determine whether the property is owner occupied primary or owner occupied secondary and document accordingly.
 </span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <span>
  If the property is owner-occupied and has a separate area of occupancy (granny flat) being used for short term rent, the owner-occupied portion of expenses is to be separated from the investment portion. Like above, the investment portion can be determined from the rental schedule in the tax return and the owner-occupied portion can be determined through a customer conversation.

  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>

          Applicants using Visa 111 must be referred to Credit for acceptance. Authorities to Return (ATR) and Return Endorsements (RE) are old style return visas issued to permanent residents between 1 March 1976 and 31 December 1986. Evidence was issued in the form of a stamp or label in the holder’s passport and contain the words ‘Authority to Return’ or ‘Return Endorsement’. Authorities to Return and Return Endorsements can no longer be granted but may still be valid. The issue with the ATR/RE is they may only be evidenced in the passport and the Department of Home Affairs will not know from their own systems whether or not the visa was ever granted.

   The Bank requires acceptable building insurance cover on a replacement and reinstatement basis over the real estate property used as security collateral for the loan.

   Insurance cover will protect the value of the secured asset in the event the owner and Bank is required to rely upon it.

   Adequate insurance cover is to be maintained for the duration of the loan.

 or ABN for a business, and the applicant is not being assessed under Fast Track, Lenders / Assessors are required to identify how the applicant is related to the business and if the applicant is a director and / or shareholder.  Where the applicant is a director and / or shareholder, further investigation of the business is to be completed (even where income from the business is not being used for serviceability assessment) to establish the below:
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     When the applicant became a director;
    </span>
   </span>
  </li>

 Where the applicant is either an Independent director or an Executive director they are not considered to be the business owner and do not need to be assessed as a self-employed applicant.
 <ul>
  <li>

    <span>
     <b>
      Independent director
     </b>
     : A director that does not have a vested interest i.e. they are not a shareholder and the directorship is not held in a business that is owned (shareholding &gt; 0%) or controlled (directorship) by a spouse or family member (e.g. child or parent) or a subsidiary entity of the director or director's spouse / family member.
    </span>

      <span>
       <span>
        <b>
         Executive director
        </b>
        : A director that does have a vested interest (a minor % shareholding of &lt;=5%) however limited to also being an independent PAYG employee.  E.g. the CEO of Westpac is a director but also an independent PAYG employee (PAYG employee of a business that is not their own business).

 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   Assessing self-employed applicants is different from assessing PAYG applicants for a number of key reasons as follows:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Salary or drawings taken from a business by a self-employed applicant may not reflect the underlying sustainable earnings capability of the business. The owner may be draining the business of its reserves by paying him/herself an inflated salary, over and above what the business can afford.
  </li>
  <li>
   The earnings of a self-employed applicant may vary significantly from year to year depending on business cycles and how well the business is performing. Significant variations may affect the applicant's ability to repay the loan and therefore the variability of income is to be included as part of the assessment process.
  </li>
  <li>
   Private and business expenses can become intermingled.
  </li>
  <li>
   Self-employed people have a greater opportunity to adjust their income to indicate servicing capacity that may not exist.
  </li>
  <li>
   Self-employed people may have a number of sources of income that have to be taken into account when assessing their capacity to service.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   A separate process is necessary for self-employed applications to:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Determine real income available for loan servicing.
  </li>
  <li>
   Ensure an appropriate legal structure for the loan.
  </li>
  <li>
   Ensure appropriate security arrangements for the loan.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  <span>
   Any non self-employed income is to be verified as per policy contained in

       The adjusted net profit and or beneficiary’s income for Serviceability value’s may be less than the actual distribution reflected in the personal return because the trust expenses may only include items that are claimable for taxation purpose.

   The loss must be reflected in the serviceability assessment.  Applicants will need to explain how any ongoing business commitments will be met.  It is vital to understand if the individuals are going to be negatively impacted by the business's financial position.  Loan application notes must capture outcomes of the Broker’s discussion with the applicant.

   if it has been identified it cannot service its commitments on its own, you are unable to rely on ‘latest year’ financial information or 'Accountants letter/email advice’.

  <li>
   Where a borrower’s shareholding in a company has reduced (e.g. 80% to 20%) across the two financial years used in the serviceability assessment or in the period preceding loan application submission and the company is trading at a loss, then the loss must be apportioned to the borrower based on the borrower’s highest percentage ownership (e.g. 80%), over the period being assessed.

         Where there are multiple self-employed applicants or entities and the applicants receive income from the same self-employed entity or if any of the self-employed entities are inter linked (income moves from one self-employed entity to another), then the income must be assessed using the same assessment method. It is however acceptable to use a different income assessment method when the business entities are completely independent of each other and there is no common flow of income.

 <span>
  <span>
   Depreciation is an accounting method for allocating the cost of a tangible or physical asset over its useful life or life expectancy. Depreciation represents how much of an asset's value has been used up. Depreciation 'expenses' are generally considered not direct costs to the business, hence cash-flow should be available to meet loan repayments.

 <span>
  <span>
   <strong>
    Note
   </strong>
   :
  </span>
 </span>
 <span>
  <span>
   Depreciation is not an acceptable addback for a Trust entity,  given the manner in which a trust utilises depreciation is quite unique and not comparable to other entity types. As a result of the method used by a trust to disburse profits to its beneficiaries, we cannot accurately determine if a beneficiary received a monetary benefit from the depreciation.

 <span>
  <span>
   Fast Track assessment is a simple Self-Employed income assessment method relying on the applicants 2 year’s personal Australian Taxation Office (ATO) Notice of Assessments (NOA's). To assess income under the Self-employed Fast Track income verification method:
  </span>
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The eligibility criteria must be met.
  </li>
  <li>
   Income from the self-employed applicant is to be verified completely from the applicants personal ATO NOA's, i.e. no further self-employed income documentation (within age of documentation requirements) is to be held or requested, where servicing is met using income from the ATO NOA’s.
  </li>
  <li>
   An ABN search must be performed on all associated self-employed entities to confirm a minimum of two full financial years self-employment. Refer to
   <a href="#R_completing_ABN_business_name_or_compan">

     completing ABN, business name or company searches
    </em>
   </a>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   If the applicant is self-employed and also has a second completely independent PAYG job, the PAYG income will also be verified from the ATO NOA’s only. If the PAYG employment commenced after the period covered by the ATO NOAs, and the income is required for serviceability assessment, then Fast Track is
   <strong>

     only

 </span>
 <span>
  <span>
   exception where income can be considered that is not captured in the ATO NOA’s held is rental income where the rental income commenced, after the financial years covered by the ATO NOA’s provided. In this instance investment property expenses must be identified and included in-line with Living Expenses policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When the applicant has investment properties that earned rental income during the ATO NOA period (either part of, or the entire period), then it is acceptable to load a $0 investment property expense for this real estate, as the expenses are already captured in the ATO NOA taxable income figure.  In this scenario the following comment, or similar, must be entered as the $0 expense explanation:
   <br/>
   <em>
    <span>
     “Nil investment property expenses captured as the rental property was owned during the period covered by the ATO NOAs (or part thereof), and the rental expenses are factored into the total taxable income figure sourced from the ATO NOA.”

    <span>
     Notes
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
  :
 </span>
 <ul>
  <li>
   When a property is only rented for part of the period covered by the ATO NOA’s no annualisation of rental income is permitted under Fast Track and there is no expectation to load additional investment property expenses.  If rental income of this nature requires annualisation for the serviceability assessment then Fast Track is
   <strong>
    <span>
     not
    </span>
   </strong>
   available and one of the

    </em>
   </a>
   policies must be used.
  </li>
  <li>
   When the ATO NOA shows franking credits, no adjustment of the taxable income is required to account for the franking credit. A franking credit must not be added to or subtracted from the Taxable income figure.
  </li>
  <li>
   When serviceability is assessed under the Fast Track method, a self-employed entity (e.g. company or trust) must not be included separately in the serviceability assessment, and verification of any commitments related to the company and / or Trust (with corporate trustee) is not required.

   To determine if an applicant is an owner or part owner of a Company a Broker should review the applicants Credit Bureau report. This credit bureau report will show any related directorships.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the Directors of the company have responsibility for the day to day management, we need to also consider who the shareholders are of the company when determining what income we can use in the loan assessment, i.e. share of profit based on being a director and percentage of shareholding. A company search will reflect the applicants current Shareholding of that entity, in addition to documenting any change(s) to shareholders and/or shareholdings since establishment of the company, where applicable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If the related entity is to a business trading name (e.g. Bluey's convenience store) but not a company (e.g. Blue Star Pty Ltd), then a business name search will reflect the applicant's relationship to the business.
  </span>

 <span>
  <span>
   An ABN search can confirm if the ABN is active, how long the ABN has been active and the GST registration status. Complete an ABN search using

 <br/>
 It is best practice to record factors relating to the assessment of self-employed / business income in all cases.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When assessing serviceability based on the latest year self-employed income and the two years average income is &gt;130% of the prior years income, it is mandatory to review the business financials and to enter supporting comments to explain:
 <ul>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      <span>
       Why there has been a change from the prior year.
      </span>
     </span>
    </span>
   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      <span>
       How the change to business profit is sustainable into the future.

   </span>
  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      <span>
       Why the income can be used for serviceability assessment.
      </span>
     </span>
    </span>
   </span>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <span>
  Supporting comments should refer to the appropriate items in the financials / tax returns where possible and may also be supported by customer conversations and additional supporting documents if appropriate.
 </span>
 <br/>

   There are many factors which can affect the profitability of business income / self-employed applicants. This guide outlines some common scenarios which may be the reason for the change in profitability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is not an exhaustive list of scenarios and each source of self-employed income will have its own unique story. These scenarios are provided to help guide you to have an insightful conversation with the borrower about why the business has experienced changes to profitability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    <span>
     Scenarios
    </span>
   </strong>
  </span>
 </span>
 <br/>
 <span>
  <span>
   When reviewing the financial information provided by the borrower if the latest years income is higher than the prior year’s income we should try to identify if the change is due to a reduction in expenses or an increase in sales.

     <br/>

       In addition to understanding how a business has increased the net profit, a Broker / Assessor should also consider potential industry or market changes that are likely to have an adverse impact on the business. To use an extreme example, during COVID-19 many restrictions were imposed which had a severe impact to industries such as tourism, retail, and hospitality, just to name a few.

      <span>
       Is the price increase permanent? Is the price increase competitive within the marketplace? Do competitors offer the same or a better product / service at a cheaper price?
       <br/>

       For example
       <br/>

       Has the business lost any customers / contracts as a result of the price increase?
      </span>
     </span>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Usually, a price increase would be intended to be permanent however what if the business competitors offer the same product / service at a reduced cost. If the competitors do not increase their price, then the business may be at risk of losing customers and may need to reduce the price to complete. While the current year may show an increase in net profit this may not be sustainable into the future as customers leave. If the business has not lost any customers as a result, this is a good outcome but what supports the change as being sustainable?
      </li>
      <li>
       To ensure the business would not lose existing contracts, the business explored what their competitors offered. As well as increasing prices they added an extra feature to the product / service.  The cost of the extra feature was negligible and factored into the price change. With the enhanced product / service the business has attracted more customers since making the change. They are benefiting from both the increased sales and change to profit margin.

Or have they decided they will target more online sales to counter the loss of foot traffic? If the business has fundamentally changed its target market (example: from walk in sales to online sales) then a cautious approach needs to be taken until the change has proven successful and sustainable.

        Generally negative gearing occurs when a rental property’s expenses (including interest) are greater than income earned from the rental property.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Australian tax system allows individuals with rental properties that are negatively geared, to deduct the loss against other income (e.g. PAYG income).

   <span>
    The 10% equity must be:

   <span>
    <span>
     <span>

  </li>
  <li>
   <span>
    <span>
     <span>
      not eroded through equity release or LMI premium capitalisation to assist with the completion of the requested loan.

       The narratives on the payslips show 'voluntary superannuation contribution' or non-SG contribution - why do I still need to get the customer to complete the salary sacrifice deduction declaration form.
      </span>
     </span>
    </td>
    <td>
     <span>
      <span>
       The salary sacrifice deduction declaration form helps us have a conversation with our customer and record the outcome of those discussions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In some cases the applicant's may be unwilling or unable to cancel the deductions, it is important that we do not make an assumption that the amount of the deduction is going to be available to meet this new loan commitment.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For example:
       <br/>
       1. The voluntary salary sacrifice deduction on the payslip is being used by the applicant towards a Self-Managed Superannuation Fund Home Loan.
       <br/>
       Because of the shortfall between rent received on the investment property and the SMSF Home loan repayment, the applicant is unable to cancel the deduction.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       2. The applicant's employer pays an additional superannuation contribution above SG where the employee makes a voluntary contribution.
      </span>
     </span>
     <br/>
     <span>
      <span>
       If the employee cancels the voluntary contribution, then they will lose the benefit of the above SG employer contribution.
      </span>
     </span>
     <br/>
     <span>
      <span>
       The applicant is unwilling to cancel the deduction as they will suffer a long term financial impact.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       3. The applicant has previously had a marital financial settlement.  So they can rebuild their superannuation they are making voluntary contributions.
      </span>
     </span>
     <br/>
     <span>
      <span>
       As they are planning for their retirement, they are unwilling to cancel the voluntary contribution amount.

    <td>
     <span>
      <span>
       If the amount of the salary sacrifice deduction is not required for serviceability assessment, then you do not need a salary sacrifice deduction declaration form. Your loan serviceability assessment will be based on the lower income figure.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The deduction is an after-tax deduction.  While you may need to include the deduction as a commitment or living expense, it is not reducing the customer's taxable income and no salary sacrifice declaration form is required.

    </td>
    <td>
     <span>
      <span>
       The applicant may need to contact their employer to check under what basis they are able to cancel the deduction.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For instance if the applicant has already taken the leave, repayment amount may be spread over the remaining year and might be unable to cancel the deduction.

       Early cancellation of the novated lease may result in negative tax implications for the customer.

       Prior to the introduction of the Salary Sacrifice Declaration form, our verification rules had different processes when the employer was a Government and not for profit organisations v's non-Government.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Through the introduction of the declaration form, we could simplify the processing of applications with salary sacrifice deductions and help ensure our customers more informed of the income we are using for serviceability assessment.

     A transaction narrative is used to identify important information relating to credit or debit transactions on an account statement or account transaction listing, e.g. who the payment is to or from, reason for the payment etc.
     <br/>
     In some cases, the transaction narratives may be restricted by character count, where this occurs the narrative may only contain a partial description of the transaction.
     <br/>
     Where a single supporting document is used for verification, the transaction narrative must contain sufficient detail to clearly identify the transaction.
     <br/>
     <b>
      Example
     </b>
     of an acceptable narrative where a single supporting document is used, may include, but is not limited to:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        <span>
         <span>
          Where verifying base salary credits to an account, the employer’s name in the narrative may appear partially or in full. To be acceptable the transaction narrative must be sufficient to be able to link the payment to the employer’s name entered in the loan application
         </span>

       </span>
      </li>
     </ul>
     Where a document(s) is used in combination with another document(s), a simpler narrative may be acceptable and must adhere to any requirements detailed in the specific policy.
     <br/>
     <b>
      Example

       National Rental Affordability Scheme - A government backed incentive scheme that seeks to address the shortage of affordable rental housing by offering financial incentives to the business sector and community organisations to build and rent dwellings to low and moderate income households at lower levels compared to market rates. NRAS aims to increase the supply of new rental dwellings and improve rental affordability.
       <br/>
       There are two distinct NRAS structures:
       <br/>
       <strong>
        <span>
         Head leases
        </span>
       </strong>
      </span>
     </span>
     <br/>
     <span>
      <span>
       Some schemes operate on a head-lease structure where the scheme operator leases the property from the investor for a 10-year period and in turn sub-leases it to a qualifying tenant. Under this structure the investor has little or no control over the selection of tenants or the selection of the property manager (with the scheme operator generally taking care of both).
       <br/>
       <strong>
        <span>
         Non-entity joint ventures (NEJV)
        </span>
       </strong>
      </span>
     </span>
     <br/>
     <span>
      <span>
       Other schemes provide for the investor to select their own property manager and in turn enter into direct residential tenancy agreements with their tenants (and involve themselves in tenant selection).

     A ‘put’ or ‘call’ option is a method that can be used in a contract of sale to reflect an agreement to sell or purchase the property for a particular price at a future point in time or on the occurrence of an event.
     <br/>
     The ‘put’ or ‘call’ option operates to provide both parties with the right (but not the obligation) to compel the other party to buy or sell the property, as follows:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <span>
        <span>
         <span>
          If a buyer exercises their ‘put’ option, this allows them to compel the vendor to sell,
         </span>
        </span>
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       <span>

         <span>
          <span>
           <span>
            <span>
             If a vendor exercises their ‘call’ option, this allows them to compel the buyer to purchase, or
            </span>
           </span>

      <li>
       <span>
        <span>
         <span>
          If there is ‘no exercise’ of the put or call option, then neither party exercises their option and the agreement comes to an end.

       A trust is an obligation imposed on a person or other entity to hold property for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The trustee is responsible for managing the trust's affairs.

     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        <span>
         Bare Trust
        </span>
       </strong>
       : A trust where there is no trust deed. This type of trust commonly arises from a single transaction (e.g. used when a superannuation fund is purchasing a property)
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        <span>
         Discretionary Trust
        </span>
       </strong>
       : The trustee has discretion as to how to distribute income and assets between beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are usually described by reference to a certain criteria. Generally, it is not possible to clearly identify all of the potential beneficiaries (e.g. a Family Trust)
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        <span>
         Unit Trust:
        </span>
       </strong>
       The beneficiaries hold units in the trust and funds and assets can be distributed according to the unit holdings. The unit holders can be easily determined at any given time. Unit Trust can be listed or unlisted.

        Duty of disclosure is owed to the insurer under the Insurance Contracts Act.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It requires disclosure to the mortgage insurer of all matters known, or that could reasonably be expected to have been known, that are relevant to the Insurer’s decision as to whether to accept the risk of the Insurance, and if so, on what terms.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This duty also extends to any subsequent renewal, variance or reinstatement of the LMI contract.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Failure to comply with the duty of disclosure, may entitle the insurer to reduce its liability under the LMI contract in respect of a claim and or to cancel the contract.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If the non-disclosure is dishonest (made knowingly), the insurer may also have the option of avoiding the contract.

 <p>
  However, where all Streamlined Refinance eligibility criteria and conditions are met, but serviceability is not met under standard serviceability assessment, a modified Serviceability Assessment Rate (SAR) may be applied as an exception to serviceability policy as below, via referral to Credit:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A minimum interest rate buffer of 1.00% (in lieu of 3.00%) will be applied in the Benchmark Repayment Amount, where SAR considers the final rate plus interest rate buffer in the serviceability calculation, for the new and / or any existing consumer mortgage liability(s)*.
  </li>
  <li>
   The standard Floor Rate will continue to apply in the Benchmark Repayment Amount Calculation, refer
   <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710">
    Serviceability Assessment
   </a>
   &gt; Serviceability Assessment Rate (SAR) – Mortgage.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Where Credit use this exception approach and approve an application based on a minimum 1% buffer SAR assessment, this must be captured as a servicing Override with Streamlined Refinance as the secondary reason code.
 </p>
 <p>
  *Secured mortgage types eligible to be assessed using the modified 1% approach, where serviceability is not met under standard serviceability policy:
