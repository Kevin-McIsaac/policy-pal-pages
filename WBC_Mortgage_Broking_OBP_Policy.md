 ## [1\. About this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_About_this_policy>)


### [1\.1 Why this policy?](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Why_this_policy?>)


This policy will help you determine the maximum loan term when assessing a residential loan application.  

  

Refer to individual Product Policies for any additional loan term restrictions or requirements that may apply to specific products.  

  

If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to [Lenders Mortgage Insurance](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000725) where
 required.     

   
## [2\. Rules you must apply](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Rules_you_must_apply>)


### [2\.1 Maximum loan term](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Assessing_maximum_loan_term>)


* The maximum term for an amortising loan is 30 years including any initial interest only (IO) period, however this may depend on the applicant’s age.
* The maximum term for a bridging loan is 12 months.


For details regarding maximum Interest Only terms refer to the table [Maximum loan terms for interest only (IO) products](#R_Maximum_loan_term_for_interest_only_(I)*.*  

  

Consideration should be given to the applicant’s remaining time in the workforce. The applicant’s ability to retire or service the new debt without the applicant incurring substantial hardship post retirement age must be considered.  

  

The ability to meet repayment obligations and clear the debt may be from: 
* Income (including retirement income), or
* Asset equity including the sale of an asset (other than primary place of residence except where the sale and downsize of the property is appropriate)

#### **[2\.1\.1 Maximum Loan Term for interest only (IO) products](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.1.1 Maximum Loan Term for interest only (IO) products>)**




| Category | Policy rule |
| --- | --- |
| Interest only (IO) converting loans repayment term | * The maximum interest only repayment period is determined by the purpose of the loan as follows:  	+ Owner occupied – the interest only repayment period may be for a minimum of 1 year up to a maximum of 5 years. 	+ Investment – the interest only repayment period may be for a minimum of 1 year up to a maximum of 10 years. * The contract loan term will be the total of the IO period plus the amortising principal and interest (P\&I) period. * The maximum total term is 30 years, noting :  	+ Construction  loans 	 **exclude** the 	 maximum 24\-month construction period (i.e. 	 the interest only period allowable to 	 complete construction) when calculating 	 maximum loan term.  [Refer to](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>)  	[Serviceability Assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710) \> Payment used for 	 serviceability * IO loans are to have a minimum loan term of the requested IO repayment period and at least an additional 1\-year P\&I term. * IO terms can be extended within product maximums. i.e. 2 year initial term and a further 3 years applied via a term extension. * After the maximum IO term expires, the loan must be converted to P\&I repayments. Further IO terms will require reorigination * For an existing owner occupied or investment loan, any requests for extension beyond the maximum IO repayment period will require the loan to be re\-originated  to legacy policy |


 


 


### [2\.2 Exit (Repayment) Strategy – Responsible Lending](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Exit_Strategy_–_Responsible_lending>)


During the Requirement and Objective (R\&O) conversation, where
 any applicant or Income Guarantor ('Spousal\-Income \+ Security
 Guarantee’ or ‘Spousal \- Income Guarantee') is 45 years or older ,
 the lender / assessor (via the broker) must:  

  
* Make further enquiries to find out when the
 applicant or Income Guarantor intends to retire (retirement
 age) and follow the additional requirements detailed in the
 Retirement age and [exit / repayment strategy table](#2.2.1 Retirement age and exit / repayment strategy).
 And
* Provide the applicant / income guarantor’s with an
 estimate of the projected outstanding loan balance at their
 declared retirement age.
 **And**
* Record the declared retirement age and the projected
 outstanding loan balance at the declared retirement age in
 the “what you told us” (Responsible lending questions)
 section of the loan application.
 **And**
* Where the applicant / income guarantor’s is: 
	+ Equal to or greater than 55 years of age;
	+ 45 years or older and is less than 10 years from retirement, then:


the declared exit / repayment strategy must also be documented.  

  

Where there is more than one applicant / income reliant guarantor,
 the age of the oldest applicant or income guarantor is to be used when
 assessing the maximum loan term.  

  

 Where a combination of exit / repayment strategies will be used, the
 details of each strategy must be documented.  

 When the applicant / income guarantor’s is relying on one or more of the
 below strategies, the associated asset values (where applicable) must be
 **greater than or equal to t**he amortised
 loan amount for the loan being requested at the intended retirement
 age.

| \# | Scenario | When applicant declares that they intend to use  Superannuation as an Exit Strategy during R\&O. **Does they intend to be retiring at age 67 or more (Government Age Pension age)?**   Please note: all scenarios will require a retirement age that  meets super preservation age. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Applicant indicates they will be retiring at  65yrs.  The loan is secured against an investment security  collateral only.  The customer also owns (unencumbered or mortgaged) an owner  occupied residence not offered as security  collateral | No. The 67yrs requirement doesn’t apply as applicant  will have 2 real estate properties upon loan settlement  (i.e.  new investment property and existing OO). |
| 2 | Applicant indicates they will be retiring at  62yrs.  The loan is secured against an investment security  collateral only.  The customer does not hold / own any owner occupied  residence (i.e. they are renting) | Yes. The 67yrs requirement is applicable here as  applicant only has 1 real estate property upon loan  settlement.   Given applicant indicates they plan to retire at 62yrs the  use of superannuation as an exit strategy is not allowed as  per policy.   would be required to have further  discussion with customers to explore other sources of exit  strategy. |
| 3 | Applicant  indicates they will be retiring at 66yrs.  The loan is secured against an owner occupied primary  security collateral and investment security  collateral. | No. The 67yrs requirement doesn’t apply as applicant  will have 2 real estate properties upon loan settlement  (i.e. investment property and OO). |
| 4 | Applicant indicates they will be retiring at  65yrs.  The loan is secured against an owner occupied security  collateral only.  The customer has other non –real estate assets (savings,  shares) but no other real estate assets. | Yes. The 67yrs requirement is applicable here as  applicant only has 1 real estate property upon loan  settlement.  Given applicant indicates they plan to retire at 65yrs the  use of superannuation as an exit strategy is not allowed as  per policy.  Broker would be required to have further discussion with  customers to explore other sources of exit  strategy. |
| 5 | Applicant indicates they will be retiring at  62yrs.  The loan is secured against an owner occupied primary  security collateral and owner occupied secondary security  collateral  The customer has no assets other than super and the above  properties | No. The 67yrs requirement doesn’t apply as applicant  will have 2 real estate properties upon loan settlement  (i.e. primary and secondary OO properties). |
| 6 | Applicant indicates they will be retiring at  62yrs.  The loan is secured against an owner occupied secondary  security collateral only (holiday home).  The applicant also holds another owner occupied residence  (i.e. their primary place of residence) | No. The 67yrs requirement doesn’t apply as applicant  will have 2 real estate properties upon loan settlement  (i.e. primary and secondary OO properties). |

### [1\.1 Why this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Why_this_policy>)


This policy will help you determine which real estate and non\-real
 estate security collateral we consider acceptable for consumer
 mortgages.  

  

To determine the maximum loan to value ratio (LVR) and valuation requirement for each type of security collateral, refer to the
*[Loan to Value Ratio (LVR)](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000684) policy* and *[Security Collateral Value](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000686) policy*.   

  

If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to [Lenders Mortgage Insurance](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000725), where
 required.     

   
### [1\.2 What is residential real estate security collateral?](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_What_is_residential_real_estate_securi>)


The Bank's consumer mortgage lending policy is primarily directed
 towards standard residential real estate, but non\-standard developments may
 also be acceptable.  

  

 The below table details the policy rules for acceptable real
 estate security collateral.  

   


| **Requirement** | Policy Rules |
| --- | --- |
| Standard real estate | Includes houses, villas, units, vacant land zoned for  residential use (up to 8 hectares) and others as defined in  this policy.   For description of each security type, refer to [Glossary](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000723). |
| Non\-standard developments | Non\-standard real estate is land or dwellings that are  not typical for example: holiday resort\-style accommodation  or former commercial real estate converted into  apartments.     We may accept non\-standard provided the customer meets  certain conditions.   For description of each security type, refer to [Glossary](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000723). |
| Security collateral objective | To ensure the borrower's root of title, the Banks'  ability to register its mortgage and having marketable value  sufficient to offset the Bank's exposure during the term of  the facility. |
| Assessing the market value of the security collateral | The following factors are to be taken into account: * Downturn in market values resulting in decreased margins * Decrease in the present income stream with resulting serviceability and (capitalised) valuation problems * Increased impact on serviceability where highly geared proposals are concerned * The potential impact of any of the above occurring at any time during the Bank's exposure is to be considered at the time of credit assessment |


  

Commercial real estate is not acceptable as security collateral in a
 consumer loan.

 A certificate of title is a document that officially grants ownership to the holder of the property referenced by that title .  

  

 The below table details the policy rules associated with obtaining and
 checking a title search.  

   


| **Requirement** | Policy Rules | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Obtain a title search | When assessing property for its acceptability as Security Collateral for a new loan, loan increase or loan variation we must complete a title search to confirm root of title which includes identifying: * The type of title * Who is the registered proprietor (the owner) * Any prior mortgages and their priority ranking * Any other restrictions or dealings registered on the title or lodged which could impact the Banks' ability to register its mortgage or act on a mortgage once registered | |
| Responsibilities | It is the responsibility of the assessor to: * obtain a copy of the title search and any dealings (registered or lodged) on the certificate of title prior to formal loan approval * review the title search, interests and dealings to ensure the property is acceptable as security * comply with the requirements and rules in this table * obtain Credit (or other Credit Risk authorised staff) approval as required | |
| Age of title search | Must comply with [Document Standards](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000692) | |
| Property Ownership | Property already owned | The owners as shown on the title search, must be exactly  the same as the borrowers (and any guarantors if  required) |
| Property being purchased | The vendor / transferrer as shown on the contract of sale and transfer description must be exactly the same as the registered proprietor (the owner) |
| Part ownership | A purchase of a part ownership share in a property  cannot be considered when all owners of the security  collateral offered, are not part of the loan application as  either borrowers or guarantors.   In all instances the borrowers / guarantors must own or be  purchasing (in the new loan application) 100% of the  property and have exclusive use and occupation entitlement  of the property used as supporting security  collateral. |
| Company title, Moiety title | The borrowers / guarantors must own or be purchasing  100% of the shares associated with the specific unit offered  as security and have exclusive use and occupation  entitlement. |

| Interests / dealings on title | The title must be free of any mortgages,  caveats, restrictive encumbrances, writs, notifications or  dealings that will not be removed prior to or simultaneously  at loan settlement   Exceptions may apply: * For *[Second Mortgages](#R_Second_Mortgage_behind_other_financial)* * When approval has been granted by Credit (or other Credit Risk authorised staff) | |
| Second Mortgage | Prior internal 1 mortgage | Acceptable to remain on title. No additional policy rules or restrictions |
| Prior external 1 mortgage | The conditions detailed under *['Second Mortgage behind other financial institution (OFI)](#R_Second_Mortgage_behind_other_financial)'* apply   Use of second mortgage may also be restricted by other policies.  Refer to: * *[Loan to value ratio](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000684)\>Assessing second mortgage* * *[Guarantees](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000696)* * Specific Product Policies |
| Submissions to Credit (or other Credit Risk authorised  staff) | When requesting approval for a mortgage,  caveat, restrictive encumbrance, Writ, notification or  dealing to remain on title, a copy of the title and dealing  must be provided to support review and consideration of any  limitations that the dealing may impose. | |
| 1 SGB, BSA, BoM and RAMS are considered to be other external providers/other financial institutions. | | |


  

 #### [2\.1\.1 Second Mortgage behind other financial institution (OFI)](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Second_Mortgage_behind_other_financial>)


The Westpac Bank Group prefers to be the only mortgagee on a security
 property.  There may be some instances where we may take a second
 mortgage, for example, where the second mortgage is covering a shortfall in
 security by the primary property (e.g. Family Security Guarantee loan
 option).  

    

A second mortgage may be taken to cover a shortfall of security
 including a guarantee where the Primary security is being taken by / or
 is already held with Westpac Bank Group registered as the 1st
 mortgagee.    

  

The below scenarios are excluded: 
* If the existing 1st mortgage is for a reverse mortgage
 styled facility
* The 1st mortgagee is not a Financial institution, i.e. is a
 private mortgage provider. Private mortgage providers include but are not
 limited to an individual, a solicitor, vendor finance.
* LMI applies to the proposed loan and the first mortgage is not held by Westpac Bank


**Note**:  

 SGB, BSA, BoM and RAMS are considered to be other external providers/other
 financial institutions.  

  

Brokers should advise the applicant(s) that second mortgage scenarios
 may lead to longer settlement time frames that are outside of Westpac Bank
 Group's control.  Delays can occur when we write to the prior mortgagee
 seeking consent to register the second mortgage and we ask the prior
 mortgagee to establish their priority amount.

| Category | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Listed security | Follow the instructions given in the register (e.g. development is not acceptable security, valuation requirement or perhaps LVR restriction). |
| Unlisted security | Check if the security is a unit in postcode Category 5 (High  Density) or 6 (High Risk) or is in a non\-standard development \-  refer to  [Assessing security collateral requirements \- non\-standard development](#R_Assessing_security_collateral_requirem) .   Every unit security development which is either in postcode Category  5 (High Density) or 6 (High Risk) or in a non\-standard development,  must be included in the SDR. |
| Unlisted unit  * not in postcode Category 5 (High Density) or 6 (High Risk), and * not a non\-standard development | Proceed as normal. |

 ### 2\.5 Assessing security collateral requirements\-general


The below table details additional policy rules to be applied when
 assessing security collateral.  

   


| **Category** | Additional requirements |

| Display homes | * Residential short form valuation (use vacant possession value as the security value) * Market rental figure in valuation to be used in serviceability test * Leaseback term no greater than 2 years (including options for renewal) * Lease document approved by Credit * Security to be an Improved Home. Vacant land and car parks are unacceptable security collateral types |
| Kit home | * Treated as owner builder * Security value of the vacant land value and any improvement permanently attached  The bank will  **not**  lend and advance any funds for purchase of the kit against  value of the (unassembled) kit, or offsite construction  costs.   Refer to [Construction loans](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000688)*.* |

| Snow leases | * Maximum term 20 years however the loan term cannot exceed or extend beyond the actual lease maturity date or term * Principal and interest repayment only * Short form valuation for a new snow lease security, (existing short form valuation for existing snow lease security). * Must be listed on the SDR |
| [Split contracts \- single residential property constructions](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000723#S)     [Split contracts \- multi\-unit residential developments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000723#S) | * Valuation with land and improvement apportionment when determining the market value on an 'as if complete' basis * The land is accessible by road and access roads have been constructed * The land is serviced by water, sewerage and electricity * The dwelling can be built on the land independently from other dwellings and such construction can occur at reasonable cost * The development approval does not prohibit independent construction * There are no restrictive covenants in relation to resale * Maximum LVR available will be dependent on other features of the security being offered.  **Risk of split contract transaction:** In all other cases the land may have no stand\-alone value and cannot be taken as security due to the following risks: * The purchaser may be required to enter into a building contract that will have common areas, party walls or common building foundations with other properties (i.e. a common builder is completing all dwellings and common property in the development) * The land is not a saleable security. This could be for various reasons including the common property (roadways and access) have not been completed at the time of settlement; the land contract prohibits sale or transfer; there is no secondary market for the land due to size, access, restrictive covenants etc. * When common property is involved (common roadways, common access ways and in particular common walls / slab) if the developer or builder ceases operation, Westpac Group will need to jointly engage with the remaining owners and financiers to complete the development. This is not an acceptable situation.  Note: 0% LVR applies during the construction period * Once these developments are fully complete, able to be occupied and individual titles issued, Westpac Group may accept these as security, as they would be considered readily saleable as a 'normal' house / townhouse / strata unit. |

 ### [2\.7 Assessing security collateral by location](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Assessing_security_collateral_by_locat>)


Some locations have restricted LVRs or mortgage insurance availability. Refer to the *[Loan to Value Ratio (LVR)](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000684) policy* and [Security Collateral Value](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000682) policy to determine any
 location specific requirements.  

   
### [2\.8 Assessing third party security collateral](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Assessing_third_party_security_collate>)

 collateral from a person/s that is **not**
 identical to the borrower. For example: 
* The borrower is a company and security collateral is offered by the company directors
* The security collateral is owned by two people and is offered as security for a loan for only one of those two people.


The bank does **not** take a third
 party mortgage, but takes: 
* A first party mortgage from all mortgagors, and


A guarantee from the mortgagors who are not borrowers. Under no
 circumstance is a third party security collateral to be taken without a
 supporting guarantee.  

  

 Third party security must also comply with *[Eligibility](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000694)*policy and *[Guarantee](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000696)*policy, to be considered acceptable security
 collateral

Refer to [Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) policy \>Unacceptable securities](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000684) for further
 details.  

   
### [2\.11 Assessing specialised security collateral](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Assessing_specialised_security_collate>)


Specialised securities are homes under the below unique housing schemes.
 Specialised security does not include [non\-standard developments](#R_Non-standard_development_definition). 
* National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS)
* [ACT asbestos affected homes ("Mr Fluffy")](#R_ACT_)
* [NSW asbestos affected homes ("Mr Fluffy")](#R_NSW_)

 #### [2\.11\.1 Security under the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS)](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Security_under_the_National_Rental_Aff>)


NRAS is a government backed incentive scheme that seeks to address the
 shortage of affordable rental housing by offering financial incentives to
 build and rent dwellings to low and moderate income households at lower
 levels compared to market rates.  

  

 There are two distinct NRAS structures: 
1. Head leases
2. Non\-entity joint ventures (NEJV)


   Refer to [Loan to Value Ratio (LVR)](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000684)
 policy to determine the maximum LVR and mortgage insurance
 availability  

   


| NRAS type | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- |

 #### [2\.11\.2 ACT asbestos affected homes ("Mr Fluffy")](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_ACT_>)


Individual owners have been written to by the ACT Government outlining a
 government buy back offer.  

  

 This is due to ongoing public health and safety risks posed by the
 continuing presence of loose fill asbestos insulation in Canberra homes.
 Participation in the Buyback Program is voluntary and eligible home owners
 must lodge an application directly with the ACT Government taskforce by
 **Tuesday, 30 June 2015**.  

  

 If the owners take up the ACT Government offer, the intent is to demolish
 dwellings and remove the contamination then return the previously affected
 blocks back to the market for resale, with former owners (shown as at
 Tuesday, 28 October 2014 as the offer is not transferable), having a first
 right of refusal to purchase the affected block (at full market value, to be
 determined at the time of purchase) after it is remediated. Owners will be
 compensated by way of the ACT Government engaging two API accredited valuers
 to determine a market value of the property as if it were not affected by
 the loose fill asbestos, in order to establish the amount to be paid as 'buy
 back'.  

  

 (Refer ACT Government web site for further background information.
 [http://www.act.gov.au/asbestos\-response\-taskforce](http://www.act.gov.au/asbestos-response-taskforce)
 .)  

    

 For the security to be acceptable the following conditions must be met:
 
* There is no current market for the sale and purchase of affected homes and therefore affected properties have a nil lending value until the ACT Government offer is made and accepted by the owners (as shown as at 28/10/14\).
* Only the ACT Government agreed security value is to be used as the security assessment. No other security assessment is to be relied on.
* A copy of the ACT Government offer must be held as the security assessment.
* Proof the ACT Government offer has been accepted by the customer must be held prior to full approval.
* All Government conditions must be met e.g. customer can only be the registered owner as at 28/10/2014 as the offer is not transferable.


#### [2\.11\.3 NSW asbestos affected homes ("Mr Fluffy")](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_NSW_>)


In NSW, owners have two options:  

  

a) Under **Option 1**, homeowners will be offered the value of the whole property (land and improvements).  

  

b) Under **Option 2**, homeowners will be offered the value of the whole property minus the value of the land. For rural properties, homeowners will be offered the value of the affected premises and any building or structures on its curtilage. The curtilage is the area, usually enclosed, that encompasses the grounds and buildings immediately surrounding the premises that are used in daily domestic activities. The effect of this process is that homeowners are offered the value of the affected premises by itself.  

  

Refer NSW Government web page for further information. <http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/Tenants_and_home_owners/Loose_fill_asbestos_insulation/Voluntary_purchase_and_demolition_program/Demolition_and_remediation_process.page>
 .  

    

**a) If the customer accepts option 1\.**  

  

Sale and discharge proceeds as normal.  

    

**b) If the customer accepts option 2\.**  

  

1\. Customer is required as part of the scheme to provide 'written
 confirmation from any financial institution that holds an interest over the
 property that acknowledges my/our intent to proceed with Option 2\.' to the
 scheme, i.e. Customer will contact the Bank to advise they have accepted
 option 2\.  

 2\. Consents team will receive customer notification and will acknowledge
 receipt to the customer.  

 3\. Customer will then provide signed License Agreement to the Bank  

 4\. When the funds from the scheme are received, the loan balance and limit
 will be reduced to a maximum of 80% of land value in the original NSW
 Government offer (i.e. NSW Government agreed security value for the
 land).  

 5\. For re\-construction of the property, a new construction loan will be
 required once customer has identified a builder. All normal lending criteria
 applies and the new Progress Draw loan will be processed as normal.  

    

**Other information**  

  

For the security to be acceptable the following conditions must be met: 
* There is no current market for the sale and purchase of affected homes and therefore affected house / unit properties have a nil lending value until the building is demolished and removed.
* Only the NSW Government agreed security value for the land is to be used as the security assessment. No other security assessment is to be relied on. The only exception to the acceptance of the land value is where customers wishes to purchase another property prior to receiving the purchase proceeds from the NSW Government and needs to fund all or part of the purchase price of the new property via a bridging loan from the Bank. The bridging loan should be processed with the following criteria:
* Customer must show evidence that they have accepted the NSW Government offer option 2 (sale of house and land) via signed License Agreement.
* The security value of the asbestos affected property is the value listed in the NSW Government offer.
* A copy of the NSW Government offer must be held as the security assessment.


    

 #### [2\.11\.4 Homes for Homes (H4H)](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Homes_for_Homes_(H4H)>)


   

 Homes for Homes (H4H) is a social housing initiative established by The Big
 Issue that will generate funds by encouraging developers and home owners to
 pledge a small percentage of the sale proceeds of their home (approx.
 0\.1%).  

    

 Standard policy rules apply for H4H properties. Refer to [Homes for Homes (H4H)](#P_Home_for_Homes_(H4H)) process for specific
 processes.

[3\.1 Home for Homes (H4H)](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#P_Home_for_Homes_(H4H)>)  

Participation in the H4H scheme is voluntary for our customers and they
 can opt\-out at any time. The scheme has been rolled out to all states in
 Australia. To facilitate this process, the owners execute a Deed of Donation
 with Homes for Homes who lodge a permissive caveat on the title. To register
 a Transfer of Ownership or Mortgage, consent from Homes for Homes will be
 required to be provided to the LTO with our settlement documents for
 lodgement.  

    

 The type of consent required by the LTO to accept the lodgement of our
 documents is specific to each state. To assist team members with
 understanding what information is required at settlement, a state based
 requirements matrix has been created.  

    

 Where our customer does not wish to donate, they can request the Withdrawal
 of Caveat from the charity, which will need to be provided at settlement if
 the customer would like the bank to lodge it as part of our lodgement
 documents.  

    

**Homes for Homes matrix**  

Brokers are to advise the customer to contact Homes for Homes and request the documents required as outlined in Homes for Homes Matrix. The originals or a copy of the documents are to be provided to Home Ownership Services prior to settlement.

## [1\. About this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_About_this_policy>)


### [1\.1 Why this policy?](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Why_this_policy?>)


This policy will help you determine the maximum loan to value ratio
 (LVR) when assessing a loan application.  

  

 You must read this policy in conjunction with [Acceptable Security Collateral](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000682) policy. The
 *[Acceptable Security Collateral](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000682)*  policy
 will help you identify the types of securities we accept in a consumer
 mortgage application.  

   
### [1\.2 What is LVR?](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_What_is_LVR?>)


LVR is a term used to express the percentage ratio of a loan to the
 value of an asset or assets that provide security collateral for a
 loan.   

  

 The bank uses LVR to: 
* Assign a maximum percentage we will lend against security property offered, with or without mortgage insurance
* Show the amount of lending (expressed as a percentage ratio) a customer may already have against a collateral
* Identify when Lender’s Mortgage (LMI) is required


By using the assigned LVRs in this policy and the [security collateral value](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000686) of the property, we can
 determine the *lending value* of the
 offered security collateral.  

  

 For definition relating to LVR, refer to [Glossary](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000723)
 for further details.  

   
## [2\. Rules you must apply](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Rules_you_must_apply>)


### [2\.1 Maximum base and / or capped LVR](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Maximum_base_LVR>)


The maximum base LVR assigned to a loan is determined by a number of
 risk characteristics of the application.  

  

**Based on the risk characteristics, a lower LVR threshold will override the maximum base LVR for owner\-occupied and investment security detailed below.**  

   


| **Category** | Maximum base LVR | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owner occupied | * **Non\-mortgage insured loan:** 80% * **Mortgage insured loan**: 95%  inclusive of any capitalised mortgage insurance (MI) premium  (if available)  **Note:** An Owner Occupied product  should only be selected where the funds are ‘wholly or  predominantly to be for personal, domestic or household  use’ | |
| Investment | * **Non\-mortgage insured loan:** 80% * **Mortgage insured loan:** 90%  inclusive of any capitalised mortgage insurance premium (if  available)  **The following is permitted where:** * Investment Property Loans (either standalone or combined with a home loan) with at least one security collateral being owner occupied can be considered up to 95% inclusive of any capitalised MI premium * Investment Property Loans (either standalone or combined with a home loan or line of credit) with all security collateral being Non\-owner occupied can be considered up to 90% inclusive of any capitalised MI premium. | |


  

 ### [2\.2 LVR based on multiple risk characteristics and multiple securities](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_LVR_based_on_multiple_risk_characteris>)




| **Category** | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| Multiple risk characteristics | Apply the **lowest**  LVR \- for example:* The LVR for a residential detached house is 80% and for a borrower using acceptable foreign income for serviceability the LVR is 70%. * The LVR for a residential detached house is 80% and for a borrower who is a resident of Greece the LVR is 0% LVR. In this situation, we would not be able to proceed as the lowest LVR is 0%. |
| Multiple security collateral | Apply the relevant LVR to each type of security  collateral to determine the total lending value. The sum of  the lending value of each proposed security is the total  amount the bank will consider lending against all securities  (see [Case examples](#C_LVR_for_multiple_security_collateral) in this policy). |


   

 For further information about risk characteristics refer to: 
* LVR by borrower type and income source
* LVR by product features and purpose
* LVR by property value
* LVR by security collateral location
* LVR by security collateral type
* Unacceptable security collateral


  

 ### [2\.3 Lenders Mortgage Insurance –additional requirements](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Lenders_Mortgage_Insurance_–additional>)


Where lenders’ mortgage insurance (LMI) is required: 
* refer to [Lenders Mortgage Insurance](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000725)
* maximum exposure to a single borrower is $2\.5M across Group (Westpac,
 St.George, RAMS) where LMI is required


  

 ### [2\.4 LVR by borrower type and income source](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_LVR_by_borrower_type_and_income_source>)


 Where there are two or more applicants (borrower or income guarantor) included on
 the loan application, the most conservative policy must be applied regardless of
 their contribution to the loan, for example:  

 An Australian citizen who is married to a permanent resident visa holder, living in
 Australia and earning foreign income, will be restricted to a maximum LVR of 70%,
 and all policies applicable to the permanent resident visa holder applicant, will
 apply.  

**Note:** Applicants who meet the Bank's definition of a non\-resident as
 per   [Lending to Non\-Australian Citizens](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000705)   policy \>
 Non\-Resident lending are unacceptable to the Bank and no lending is
 permitted.  

  

Refer to  [Lending to Non\-Australian Citizens](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000702)  policy for acceptable
 visa class and confirmation if LMI available   

  
 

| Borrower type | Income source | Borrower location | Non\-MI – max base LVR | MI – Max base and capitalised (cap) LVR | |

 ### [2\.10 Second mortgage](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Second_mortgage>)


The bank takes a second mortgage over a security property, where there
 is a prior mortgagee (e.g. where the first mortgage is held by another
 financial institution).  

  

 STG, BSA, BoM and RAMS are considered to be other financial
 institutions.  

  

 Mortgage insurance is not available where a second mortgage applies.  

  

 For more information about assessing the second mortgage
 applications you may also refer to  *[Acceptable Security Collateral \> Certificate of title \> Second Mortgage behind other financial institution (OFI)](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000682)*  

   


| Second mortgage lending value calculation and priority amount conditions | |
| --- | --- |
| Category | Action |
| Calculation | A 20% buffer for contingencies is to be used in the  calculation of the Lending value.  **a**.  Determine the lending value of the offered security property  (using the security value and assigned LVR)  **b**. Identify  the value of the debts secured by the first mortgage with  the other external financial institution (higher of limits  or outstanding balance of loan)  **c**. Multiply  figure at b by 120%  **d.** Remaining  available lending value \= a – c   refer to [Example](#C_First_and_second_mortgage_security_col)  for illustration. |
| Priority amount \-Special condition for settlement | Write to the prior mortgagee seeking consent requesting  that the prior mortgagee establish their priority  amount.   The priority amount must be no more than the amount  initially used to calculate the lending value for our loan  (i.e. higher of the limit or balance outstanding plus 20%).  If this occurs, you must seek additional approvals from  Credit. |

### [2\.12 Debt allocation / Debt apportioning](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Debt_allocation/Debt_apportioning>)


 Debt allocation may be required when assessing a loan application (new origination or variation) where the borrower: 
* Has an existing debt secured by two or more properties and the
 existing debt is not being refinanced (either partially or in full),
 **and**
* Not all properties securing the existing debt will be used as security collateral in the new loan.


**Note:** Debt allocation is not required where all the security collateral
 properties for the existing debt, are being offered as security collateral for the
 new loan origination or variation.  

  

**The following debt allocation principles apply:** 
* For properties offered as security collateral on the new loan, the market value from an existing acceptable valuation (where applicable) or new valuation, is the market value used in the new loan application
* Where a property is not being used as security
 collateral for the new loan but will remain a security
 collateral for an existing debt, it is shown as an asset
 property in the new loan application. The value of the
 asset property entered will be the market value from an
 existing valuation where it is acceptable to be re\-used,
 or a new valuation (where the existing valuation cannot
 be re\-used), refer  [Security Collateral Value Assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000686)  \> Re\-using an
 Existing Valuation.
* Where two or more new loans are proceeding at the same:
	+ Under a single submission, each new loan must mirror each other, i.e. all new loans must reflect the other new loan(s), regardless of whether or not the new loans will settle / draw down simultaneously, or
	+ In concurrent submissions and:
		- Settling simultaneously, then each concurrent loan must mirror each other.
		- Not settling simultaneously (i.e. waterfall), application supporting notes must identify the order in which the loans will settle / draw down and each new loan must be reflected in any subsequent concurrent application.
* The maximum permitted non\-LMI LVR is applied
 to each security collateral and asset property, which
 may include a higher LVR policy where LMI is waived
 (e.g. Medico 90%), refer to rules in this chapter.
 Noting however, that **lower LVR thresholds may apply** according to borrower type and income
 source, product features and purpose, property value,
 security location and type e.g. where foreign income is
 included in servicing a max LVR 70% applies to all
 security collateral(s) and existing asset
 property(s).
* Debt allocation can only be applied between properties owned by the borrower(s)


 **Debt allocation cannot be applied where:** 
* The security collateral is partially or fully owned by a non\-borrower, e.g. where a family security guarantee supports an existing debt.
* Any of the existing security collateral are under construction, until such time as the loan has been fully advanced and the construction is complete. This includes where an existing construction loan has multiple security collateral.
* **An application is Mortgage insured,**unless
 **all** insured security
 collateral are linked to the new loan. Where this
 occurs, the LMI premium will be calculated on the TSE
 and will require referral to Mortgage Insurer for a
 manual premium calculation

| Category | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Acceptable | It is **acceptable**  where an existing customer is going to cross collateralise the  security/loans and there is no cash out to the customer, only  additional funds for the purchase settlement. |
| Not acceptable | It is **not acceptable**  where an existing customer wants to access equity to assist  with a new purchase, but is not cross collateralising the  security, i.e. each transaction will be standalone. The  release of equity is classified as cash out and not  permitted.  The new loan for the purchase may proceed at LVR 70% but no  additional equity release against the existing property is  possible. It does not matter if the proposed new loan is  with Westpac or external financier. |

 ## [1\. About this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_About_this_policy>)


### [1\.1 Why this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Why_this_policy>)


This policy lists the rules you must apply when assessing residential security collateral risk for consumer mortgage lending.  

  

Note: N on\-specialised commercial
 security collateral may be considered on
 an **exception** basis when
 approved by Credit.   

  

The bank performs several validation checks in our origination system. These additional checks form part of the overall valuation strategy and policy.   

  

Refer to this policy in conjunction with [Acceptable Security Collateral](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000682) and *[Loan to Value Ratio (LVR)](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000684) \> Calculating the LVR and Security
 value.*  

  

For definitions relating to this policy, refer to [Glossary](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000723).  

  

 If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to [Lenders Mortgage Insurance](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000725) where
 required.     

   
### [1\.2 Security collateral value \- Market Value](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Security_collateral_value>)


Market value for real estate is defined as: 
* ‘The estimated amount which a seller would expect to receive from an informed purchaser for the property in the current resale market with normal marketing support through an Australian based real estate agency. The market value is determined on a vacant possession basis and must exclude purchase incentives, non\-fixed chattels, legal / stamp duty costs and rental guarantees.’


A market value assessed on this basis
 will **not** reflect the mortgagee in
 possession or other forced sale circumstances.  

  

 Also see:
 * [More than one market value](#R_More_than_one_market_value)
* [Contract of Sale (COS)](#R_Contract_of_Sales_(Purchase_Price))


### [1\.3 What are acceptable real estate valuation methods?](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_What_are_acceptable_real_estate_valuat>)


The bank accepts the following real estate valuation methods and will apply the below hierarchy where multiple valuations are held within the acceptable age limit: 
1. Residential \& Construction Long Form valuation
2. Residential \& Construction Short Form valuation
3. Desktop valuation
4. Automated Valuation Model (AVM) (also known as Modelled Estimate, Electronic Assessment, E\-Val)


 e.g. If the existing valuations are AVM, Desktop and Short Form, then use the Short Form   

  

 
## [2\. Rules you must apply](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Rules_you_must_apply>)


   

 ### [2\.1 Customer estimated market value](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Amending_the_customer_estimated_market>)


 The customer estimated market value is the estimated dollar value the customer
 provides us of their residential real estate property.  

 During the R\&O conversation a discussion would be had with the customer about
 the amount of funding they require and what the funds would be used for. It is
 reasonable to assume the customer estimate value of their property is sufficient to
 meet their needs in line with the R\&O.  

The customer estimated market value is not to be amended within an application once a valuation (any type) has been completed.  

  

 Also see [Automated Valuation Model (AVM)](#2.10 Automated Valuation Model (AVM)).  

  
 ### 2\.2 Assessing security collateral value using the valuation report


Valuation reports are only to be accepted from valuers on the Westpac Group approved Residential Valuer panel. All valuation reports are to be addressed to the Bank.  

  
 ### [2\.3 Requesting a Valuation Report](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Requesting_a_Valuation_Report>)


A valuation report:
* can only be requested by an authorised staff member or Broker of Westpac Banking Group and must be ordered via Property Hub
* **cannot be** requested
 for the purchase of a property where the offer has not been
 accepted by the owner (to assist a prospective purchaser
 e.g. pre\-purchase valuations are not permitted
 )


  

 ### [2\.4 Ownership of Valuation Report](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R__Ownership_of_Valuation_Report>)


All valuation reports remain the property of the Bank and should not be offered to the customer. Reports are prepared for and addressed to the Bank for residential mortgage lending purposes.  

  

 If a customer requires a copy of the bank valuation to support their application for
 a grant, the customer is to complete the ‘ Customer declaration and
 acknowledgement ’ form and only on receipt of the signed form can the valuation be
 provided to the customer.  

 
### [2\.5 Reading the Valuation Report](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Reading_the_Valuation_Report>)


The valuation report must be read in its entirety. Adverse comments in
 the valuation report may make the property unacceptable as security
 collateral, characteristics are to be further investigated and where
 necessary, the application is to be referred to Credit.  

  

 Refer to [Process \> Reviewing and actioning a Residential Short Form Valuation](#P_Residential_Short_Form_Valuation)  

  
 ### [2\.6 Risk Rating in Valuation Report](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#P_Risk_Rating_of_Valuation_Report>)




| Non\-mortgage insured  Includes applications assessed with LMI waived under:* ‘Special Packages’ LMI waiver policies,  **or** * [Lenders Mortgage Insurance](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000725)  policy \> Existing  insured loans \- Variations and Top Up premiums  \> LMI waiver – Legacy LMI providers ‘QBE and  Helia (formerly Genworth)’ | | |

 ### [2\.7 More than one market value](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_More_than_one_market_value>)


In situations where more than 1 market value is available on the one valuation report, use the lower of the values except where: 
* Credit (or other Credit Risk authorised staff) have approved using a higher value, or
* Where the below applies


Where the security collateral is subject to a Defence Housing Authority (DHA) sale and leaseback arrangement, the panel valuer's valuation report will contain 2 property values. The lower figure represents the vacant possession value. The higher figure is the vacant possession value plus the worth of the government rental guarantee. Where the loan is mortgage insured or requires a valuation, then the higher figure is acceptable if: 
* The rental guarantee assessment is **not** greater
 than 110% of the vacant possession assessment
* The loan is amortising
* The lease has 6 or more years to run excluding options to renew. Where the
 loan is **not** subject to mortgage insurance or
 the LVR ≤ 80%, then the higher valuation figure is acceptable.


  

 ### [2\.8 Contract of Sales (Purchase Price)](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Contract_of_Sales_(Purchase_Price)>)


 A Contact of Sale (COS) is not to be used in isolation as a security collateral
 value assessment.  

 Also see:
 * Requirements to obtain a COS
* Review of COS
* Minimum criteria to be obtained from the COS
* Automated Valuation Model ( [AVM](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>) )


  

 #### 2\.8\.1 Requirements to obtain a COS


 A fully executed contract by the vendor and purchaser **must be held prior to settlement** where:

 * The application is to be mortgage insured
* The application includes a First Home Owner Grant (FHOG)
* An AVM is being used to validate the purchase price as the security valuation method. You must identify if the purchase price includes any non\-fixed chattels, rebates or incentives offered.


 A full copy of the COS (does not need to be fully executed) must be held when an SDR
 assessment is required on the property being purchased.  

For all other circumstances a full copy of the COS is preferred but not mandatory.   

 
#### [2\.8\.2 Review of COS](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.8.2 Review of COS>)


 A COS received during the application process  must be reviewed to:
* ensure the security meets  the below criteria
 :
	+ the property must be zoned to allow
	 residential usage. For further
	 information refer to  [Acceptable Security Collateral](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000682)  policy
	 \> Assessing security collateral
	 requirements
	+ the cost / value of
	 any chattels (e.g. furnishings)
	 and / or rebates or incentives being
	 offered by the vendor are to be
	 deducted from the total purchase
	 price to determine the security
	 value. Refer to [Chattels, Rebates and Incentives](#2.9 Chattels, Rebates and Incentives)
	+ the security is being purchased
* Request a valuation report via Property Hub where it is identified that:
	+ the transaction is **not** being
	 completed at arm's length through an independent
	 Australian based real estate agent (i.e. it is a
	 private sale), or
	+ the Contract of Sale indicates a ‘Put and Call’ contract , or
	+ the Contract of Sale is older than 3 months


 If the COS is undated and is **not** a First Home Owners Grant (FHOG)
 application, assume that the contract date is the date the Privacy Consent was
 obtained.  

  

Also refer to: 
* Contract of sale (purchase price)
* Minimum criteria to be obtained from the Contract of Sale


  

 #### [2\.8\.3 Minimum Criteria to be obtained from the Contract of Sale](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.8.3 Minimum Criteria to be obtained from the Contract of Sale>)


Where you are required to obtain a copy of the
 contract of sale, the document must display the minimum criteria
 as per  [Document Standards](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000692) 
### [2\.9 Chattels, Rebates and Incentives](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.9 Chattels, Rebates and Incentives>)


 Where a contract of sale includes any non\-fixed chattels  [\#](#2.9.1 Chattels)  , Rebates or Incentives offered, the
 cost / value of any non\-fixed chattels (e.g. furnishings) and / or the value of any
 rebates or incentives offered by the vendor are to be deducted from the total
 purchase price to determine the security value which is entered in the origination
 platform.  

Where this adjustment to the security value is required, an AVM can\-not be used to validate the COS purchase price. The AVM is not to be ordered and the next higher valuation type is to be requested.  

  
 #### 2\.9\.1 Chattels


 \#  The below list of chattels are to be assessed as 'fixed' and no
 further action is required when they are specified in a contract of sale:

 * Air conditioning equipment (including heaters and fans)
* BBQs
* Built in furniture, outdoor furniture
* Carpets / floor coverings
* Clothes dryer, washing machine
* Dishwashers
* Fish tanks
* Fridges / Freezers
* Garden decor (statues, ponds, lights, plants, pots, fountains etc.)
* Garden irrigation equipment (i.e. domestic use)
* Garden sheds, clothes lines, cubby houses, bird aviary
* Kitchen island benches detached / movable
* Inbuilt Audio / Video systems (including home theatre systems)
* Lawn mowers (including ride on mowers)
* Light fittings
* Ovens (including Microwave ovens) / Cooktops / Rangehoods
* Pool tables
* Pools, spas and equipment
* Remote control devices
* Security systems
* Septic tanks
* Television (including TV antennas, satellite dish or pay TV equipment)
* Wardrobes
* Water tanks / pumps
* Window treatments


### **[2\.10 Automated Valuation Model (AVM)](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.10 Automated Valuation Model (AVM)>)**


 An Automated Valuation Model (AVM) is an electronic valuation that is completed
 based on recent property sales in the area. They are also known as Modelled
 Estimate, Electronic Assessment or E\-Vals. An AVM is a brief report that indicates
 the amount the property is worth.  

  

 Where an AVM search on a security collateral property is successful, it is used to
 validate the purchase price (COS) **or** the customer estimated market value. The
 validation is restricted to:

 * the specific customer the AVM was ordered for, and
* only being used where the LVR for the loan (i.e. the
 LVR inclusive of all security values) is **equal to or less than** the
 **maximum end LVR** (i.e.
 capitalised LVR) value returned with the
 search.


Where an AVM for a security collateral in the loan returns a maximum end LVR result that is less than the LVR for the loan, then the security collateral will require an alternate valuation method (either a Desktop if policy permits, or a full valuation).  

  

**Where an AVM has been completed, the customer estimated market value is not to be amended**. The AVM result can only be relied upon based on the original customer estimated market value or contract price. 



### **[2\.11 Valuation amount lower than purchase price](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.13 Valuation amount lower than purchase price>)**


There may be circumstances in which the valuation of a
 property is significantly less than the stated purchase
 price.  

    

 Where the valuation amount is less than 90% of the purchase
 price, the customers (and guarantor/s if any) are to be
 informed in writing and their written acknowledgement
 obtained.  

  

 For applications approved via OBP, borrower/s are informed
 of, and acknowledge their acceptance (wet signature or
 digital) via the application 'playback 'document, which is
 part of the loan offer pack. Guarantor/s receive the
 application 'playback 'document with their guarantee
 documents to review before signing a  [guarantee](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>)   

  
 


### [2\.12 Re\-using an Existing Valuation](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Re-using_an_Existing_Valuation>)


Valuation methods previously used to determine the value of
 a security collateral are stored in the Bank’s system and ValEx and may
 be re\-used subject to meeting policy requirements.    

 Existing valuation results (excluding AVM) held in the valuation system for
 a specific property may be used for a different customer as a valid existing
 valuation in terms of assessing residential security.

| --- | --- |
| Mortgage Insured loan | Any of the below: |
| The Valuation Risk Alerts (VRAs) answered ‘Yes’ to1. Does the subject property comprise a higher risk or a non\-residential property type? 2. Are there any adverse marketability issues that would require an extended selling period of more than 6 months? 3. Are the existing improvements on the property incomplete, under construction or requiring essential repairs? 4. Is the subject property critically affected by any Heritage, location or environmental issues? |
| Any other Critical Risk or adverse features highlighted in valuer's comments (other than above) 1\. "Critical" risks \- specific to the subject property  and/or considered to have a negative impact on marketability  or value of the subject property  2\. Adverse features evident on the valuation.     Defined as "Any material adverse risks affecting the subject property " including but not limited to: * property incomplete or poorly maintained and in need of repairs (Essential Repairs / Repairs \>$5k). * being sold by a builder/developer (where valuer comment relates to Rebates, cash\-back arrangements evident or other adverse comments relating to Purchase or Building Contracts) * any part of the property not being used for its designed purpose, is something other than strictly residential, any structures/ improvements that may not be council approved * property is affected by a "critical risk" attributable to any heritage, location or environmental issues (the risk is specific to the property and is not generally accepted by the market) * the property saleability and/or value may be adversely affected by a "critical risk" specific to the property, or known/observable encumbrances, issues or on\-going heightened concern as advised by the valuer, that is not generally accepted by the market or results is restricted marketability (e.g. RTA affectation, restricted use, adverse easements , proximity to Railway Lines , Commercial/Industrial Area, Adverse Zoning, restricted use/unique in nature) * Selling period \>6 months * Minimum requirements for Sales Evidence unavailable/ Lack of acceptable Comparable Sales. (At least three (3\) comparable sales presented. Comparable sales to be like\-for\-like (property), preferably within 15% variance and within 6 months of the valuation date.)  NOTE: Permissible for two (2\) comparable sales held within acceptable parameters, in addition with one (1\) sale outside supported by a satisfactory explanation and where other strengths are evident within the application. |
| Any scenario requiring referral as detailed under [Risk Rating of Valuation Report](#P_Risk_Rating_of_Valuation_Report)*.* |

### 3\.3 Reviewing and actioning a Residential Long Form Valuation


Residential Long Form valuation reports are all to be assessed to determine if the property is acceptable as security and the valuation amount to be accepted.  

  

This Includes (but not limited to):
* Property use and description matches the security characteristics within the loan assessment system– (e.g. Mixed use, Land Size Etc)
* Review the content of a valuation report in full
* Where necessary on review of valuation, and adverse features are apparent (including Risk Ratings as below) the application is to be referred to Credit


Refer to ['How to read a long form valuation'](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/ci/okcsFattach/getFile/1000686/03.04%20How%20to%20read%20a%20long%20form%20valuation%20guide.pdf)guide.  

  
### [3\.4 Valuation Review](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#P_Valuation_Review_and_Check_Valuation>)




| Step | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Read the valuation in its entirety, as often the valuer’s comments in the report and the comparable sales utilised will explain and/or clarify why the valuation has come in lower than the customer's estimate. At this point the customer’s concerns can be managed by the broker without further consultation or delay. |
| 2 | If after reading the valuation fully and customer is  still not satisfied with the explanation provided by  the  broker **and** there is other relevant factual sales information\* that supports consideration for a review, then the valuation can be queried as follows:* The Broker can request Mortgage Operations to raise a Value Query directly with the Valuer in ValEx system and provide the additional comparable sales for consideration (settled sales will be viewed more favourably).  **Note:**  To ensure service levels are not compromised, communications  with the valuer must be kept brief, factual and professional  at all times. Inappropriate behaviour will not be tolerated,  and all instances will be referred to the respective state  general manager for action as required. \*Relevant information includes:* Commentary confirming an oversight or error made by the  valuer; **or** * Valid Comparable sales (which do not already appear in the  valuation report) within the last 6 months, with details of: 	+ Within the same location and not from within the same complex if a new development similar price range 	+ Similar with regards to condition, price range, type of property, land size, and layout (bedrooms, bathrooms etc)   **Note**: Sales evidence cannot include  properties sold directly from the Developer; they must be  re\-sales. |
| 3 | The valuer will review the valuation query and  either agree to adjust the valuation **or**  reconfirm the original valuation.      If the valuer agrees to adjust the valuation, the report will be amended and delivered through ValEx.     Note: The valuer must support the adjusted valuations with appropriate justifiable comments and/or additional sales evidence. Should CoreLogic compliance identify an issue with the report, it will be returned to the Valuer to review.    Note: Lodging a query does not guarantee the valuation will be amended, therefore customers should not be prematurely advised of a possible outcome. |

 ## [1\. About this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_About_this_policy>)


  

 ### [1\.1 Definition of a commitment](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Definition_of_a_commitment>)


A commitment is any regular repayment which a
 **b**orrower or income guarantor (Spousal\-Income Guarantee or Spousal\-Income \+ Security Guarantee)**** may have.
 Commitments may be referred to as a debt, liability or facility which may be
 secured or unsecured.  The commitment may vary from payment to payment,
 like the minimum payment on a credit card or be fixed at a nominated amount,
 for instance a personal loan repayment with a fixed interest rate.  

  

 Excludes items which are captured within [Living Expenses](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000700) policy.  

   
### [1\.2 Why this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Why_this_policy>)


This policy will help you in verifying existing commitments and
 repayment conduct.  

  

 This is a key part of the unsuitability assessment and is required for every
 applicant who is either a borrower or income\-reliant guarantor.   

  

 Verification of the applicant's commitments ensures accurate information is
 used in completing a financial assessment and serviceability
 calculation.  

  

 Repayment history on existing debts is considered to be a critical indicator
 of an applicant's credit worthiness and ability to meet commitments.  

  

 This policy is applicable where the loan activity is a: 
* New loan application
* Loan increase
* Any servicing (variation) activity requiring a serviceability assessment


You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to: 
* [Serviceability assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710)
* [Loan Application and Approval \> Validation of information provided by the customer](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698)
* [Living expenses](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000700)
* [Document Standards](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000692)


   

 If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to [Lenders Mortgage Insurance](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000725) where required.     

   
## [2\. Rules you must apply](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Rules_you_must_apply>)


  

 ### [2\.1 Policy exclusions](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Policy_exclusions>)


   This policy does not apply to a Bridging ICAP loan without an end debt.   

  
 ### 2\.2 Customer commitments


  

To ensure we accurately assess our customer's financial position we need to: 
* Collect information about their commitments.
* Verify the details of the commitment, refer to:
	+ Confirm the details of the commitment
	+ Financial hardship arrangement check and evidence satisfactory repayment history


  

 ### 2\.3 Conflicting information


Further investigation may be required if we have identified any conflicts between any information (including Comprehensive Credit Bureau Report (CCR) data where applicable) and other supporting documents provided by the applicant. Refer to [Loan Application and Approval \> Validation of information provided by the customer](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698)  

  

  

In addition to the Commitments policy requirements, Brokers are reminded to complete the scrutiny activity as outlined in [Loan Application and Approval \> Validation of information provided by the customer](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698)
### [2\.4 Confirm the details of the commitment](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Confirm_the_details_of_the_commitment>)


  

 

| Verification task | **Additional information** |
| --- | --- |
| Confirm the details of the commitment | This activity contributes to the accuracy of our  serviceability calculation, making sure we have correct  details of outstanding balances and or limits and or  repayment amounts.   Each commitment type within the 'Confirm commitment details'  section of this policy outlines: * the mandatory details we must verify, * acceptable documents we can use, * any allowable variances for each commitment type  You can use the links below to navigate to the specific  commitment type or scroll down the page to see the  commitments listed in [alphabetical](#R_alphabetical_listing_confirm_details_o)  order.  * Common liability types * Other liability types * [Liabilities with amendments required before Unconditional Approval](#R_Details_-_Liability_types_amndmts_prio) * Non\-discretionary expenses requiring verification |
| **Note**: Post  Unconditional approval, account / Bpay details may be  required if they aren't included in the documents used for  verification of the commitment, in order to make the payment  into any liabilities being cleared and closed or reduced  using loan funds.   Refinance is where some or all of the loan funds are being  advanced to repay and refinance debts currently with Westpac  (WBC), St George Bank Group and/or other financial  institutions. This may involve a new loan or could include  an increase on an existing loan to repay other debts, i.e.  where an existing debt is being: * Cleared * Refinanced * Limit reduced | |

 ### 2\.5 Financial hardship arrangement check and evidence satisfactory repayment history


  

 

| Verification task | **Additional information** |
| --- | --- |
| **Financial hardship arrangement check**   Identifying and reviewing performance of formal financial hardship  arrangements | Where a borrower is experiencing difficulty paying their current  commitments, they may enter into formal financial hardship  arrangements with a credit or finance provider.  Poor conduct  may occur even where such arrangements are in place.   Identifying and reviewing performance of formal financial hardship  arrangements applies to active commitments held by borrowers and /  or income guarantors (WBC only) which are listed on the CCR bureau  report.   You are required to manually obtain and review the PDF version of  the CCR bureau report to identify if the customer is specifically in  temporary relief or has a deferral financial hardship arrangement in  place **and** they are operating within the agreed  arrangements.   This check is not required where policy does not require a CCR to be  generated. E.g. for a Servicing (Variation) activity where no CCR is  required to be generated.   The ‘financial hardship arrangement check’ policy applies to  commitments held with both the Westpac Group or external1  parties for each commitment type which appears on the CCR and tells  us how to complete a financial hardship arrangement check.   An application where a borrower and / or income guarantors are  in temporary relief or a deferral financial hardship arrangement is  in place **may** be referred to Credit for consideration if  mitigants and additional supporting documents are provided. For  example, details of the formal financial hardship arrangement.   You can use the links below to navigate to the specific commitment  type or scroll down the page to see the commitments listed in  alphabetical order. Each commitment type will set out the  requirements for verification.   * **Liability and Commitment Types**  **:** 	+ Refinance permitted 	+ Refinance not permitted * Liabilities and Commitments that are exempt from Financial Hardship Arrangement checks or Conduct checks * CCR Financial Hardship Arrangement criteria    ‘Evidence satisfactory repayment history’ is a separate verification  activity. You must also comply with the associated rules below. |
| Evidence satisfactory repayment history | A review of historical account conduct forms a key  component of the Westpac unsuitability assessment.   Unsatisfactory conduct can be a sign an applicant is  experiencing hardship in managing their current debt  commitments.    Verification of conduct applies to active commitments held  by borrowers and/or income guarantors (WBC only).   If the commitment has been operating for less than the  specified time frame, conduct is to be assessed from the  date the commitment was established.   The 'Evidence satisfactory repayment history' check policy  applies to commitments held with both the Westpac Group  **or** external  parties1 for each commitment type and tells us:  * when and how to complete a repayment history check * what represents 'satisfactory' repayment history * the time period we need to review  You will need to refer to the ['Not on CCR \- Verifying repayment history when not using CCR'](#R_Not_on_CCR_-_verifying_repayment_histo) rules where any of the below apply:  * the commitment is not displayed on the CCR * repayment history demonstrated on CCR is blank * a commitment has recently been approved  **but** is not yet open **or** has been  open for less than 1 month * policy specifies that the 'Not on CCR' process / policy is to be followed * policy does not require a CCR to be generated  You can use the links below to navigate to the specific commitment type or scroll down the page to see the commitments listed in alphabetical order. Each commitment type will set out the minimum requirements for verification and includes the minimum acceptable documents. * **Liability and Commitment Types**  **:** 	+ Refinance permitted 	+ Refinance not permitted * [Liabilities and Commitments exempt from financial hardship arrangement or conduct checks](#R_Liabilities_exempt_from_conduct_checks) |
| 1 For the purpose of this policy, St George Bank Group and RAMS are considered to be external providers **Note**: Post  Unconditional Approval, account / Bpay details may need to  be supplied if they aren't included in the documents used  for verification of the commitment, in order to make the  payment into any liabilities being cleared and closed or  reduced using loan funds.   Refinance is where some or all of the loan funds are being  advanced to repay and refinance debts currently with Westpac  (WBC), St George Bank Group and/or other financial  institutions. This may involve a new loan or could include  an increase on an existing loan to repay other debts, iI.e.  where an existing debt is being: * Cleared * Refinanced * Limit reduced | |

 ### 2\.7 Allowable Variances


  

 

| Allowable Variances | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commitment type | The below variances between the commitment  information used within the application serviceability  assessment and the information detailed on the supporting  document/s are permitted.     The variances are acceptable as they result in a more  conservative monthly repayment amount being calculated for  use within the serviceability assessment, or do not impact  the calculated monthly repayment. | |
| Buy Now Pay Later Business Loan  Centrelink debt Commercial Bill Credit Cards Hire Purchase Lease Line of Credit (unsecured / non\-mortgage) Margin loan Mortgages MyBenefits Loans Other  Overdraft (unsecured / non\-mortgage) Personal Loans  Tax Debt Type A Term Loan | Limit | * The supporting document evidences a lower limit than the value entered into the assessment system / used for the monthly repayment calculation |
| Balance | * The supporting document evidences a lower balance than the value entered into the application / used for the monthly repayment calculation or; * Applies only where limit is mandatory to be verified:  	+ the supporting document evidences a higher balance than the value entered the application / used for the monthly repayment calculation. The balance on supporting document must be less than or equal to the limit entered the assessment system / used for the monthly repayment calculation |
| Interest rate | * Applies where the commitment type has  **not** been  negatively geared (e.g. no interest deduction has been  applied for the specific debt to the serviceability  calculation) 	+ The supporting document evidences a lower interest rate then the value entered the assessment system / used for the monthly repayment calculation * **Does not apply** where the commitment is a mortgage that has been negatively geared or where an interest deduction (for the specific debt) is being applied to the serviceability calculation. Including when the commitment is a company commitment or a trust with corporate trustee. In these scenarios the actual interest rate on the supporting document must be the same as the value entered in the assessment system to ensure we accurately reflect the negative gearing / interest deduction. |
| Repayment type | * The supporting document evidences a principal and interest (P\&I) repayment method but an interest only (I/O) remaining term has been included in the assessment system / used for the monthly repayment calculation |
| Remaining term | * The supporting document evidences an interest only (I/O) remaining term and/or total remaining term which differs to the value included in the assessment system / used for the monthly repayment calculation * The difference must be less than or equal to two months |
| Minimum Payment | * The supporting document evidences a lower minimum payment than the value entered in the assessment system |


  

 ### [2\.8 Time Frame / Age of document definition](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Time_Frame_/_Age_of_document_definitio>)


 When calculating if the document meets the required timeframe or
 age of document requirements the following definitions are to be used:  

   


| The definition of 1 month is | The first day of the month up to and including the last  day of the same month (e.g. 1/1/2018 to 31/1/2018\)   or  Any day in the first month up to and including one day prior  in the next month (e.g. 15/1/2018 to 14/2/2018\) |
| --- | --- |
| The definition of 2 months is | The first day of  month up to and including the  last day of the following month (e.g. 1/1/2018 to  28/2/2018\)  or  Any day in the first (given)  month up to and including  one day prior in the following second month (e.g. 15/1/2018  to 14/3/2018\) |
| The same methodology may be extrapolated out to any higher number of months. | |


   

   
### 2\.9 Not on CCR \- Verifying repayment history when not using CCR


 Supporting documents must be obtained: 
* where a commitment is not yet open **or** has
 been open for less than 1 month to confirm repayments are
 not due yet\*; **or**
* to establish repayment history where the:
	+ commitment type is not
	 displayed on the Comprehensive Credit
	 Report (CCR) and the liability or
	  commitment is not exempt from
	 financial hardship arrangement checks or
	 conduct checks; **or**
	+ commitment is on CCR but
	 the current, 2nd and
	 3rd months display all R and
	 / or P special values and repayment
	 history cannot be established using CCR
	 alone.


 \*No further repayment history checks (or financial hardship arrangement
 checks) are required where the supporting document confirms the first payment
 date has not yet fallen due, refer  Acceptable Documents \> commitment type \> Commitment recently approved or established
.   

   

**Notes:** 
* If the commitment has been operating for less than the specified time frame, conduct is to be assessed from the date the commitment was established


  

 

|  | Commitment type | Repayment history is considered unsatisfactory when: | **What do I need to do?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | "Buy Now Pay Later' Commitment from providers: * Afterpay * Laybuy * Sezzle * Deferit * PayPal Payin4 * Klarna * PayItLater * StepPay | Supporting document shows evidence of direct debit/s to  the provider which are returned / reversed / dishonoured /  rejected | **In all cases** where unsatisfactory  conduct is evident:  * the balance of the facility is to be  verified (if the application is to proceed).  **Note**: You may need to obtain an  additional supporting document to verify the  balance. Refer to Acceptable documents \>  commitment type table * If the most recent account balance evidenced is \> the commitment limit, then: 	+ The most recent account balance is 	 to be updated in the origination 	 platform; 	 **and** 	+ Serviceability is to be assessed using the most recent balance (where applicable for debts that use the higher of either the balance or limit for serviceability assessment.) Refer to Serviceability Assessment \> Commitments \> Serviceability repayment amount \> Type of commitment    Also see:   * [Document Standards](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000692): 	+ Minimum Document Standards 	+ Age of documents |
| For all other commitment types | Supporting document shows evidence of:* Arrears (may be in the form of statement messages, late fees, legal fees, default interest, etc.) * Cheque dishonours * Payment reversals * Overdue payments * Limit exceeded or over limit fees being charged |

## [4\. Frequently asked questions](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#F_Frequently_asked_questions>)


  

 

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Are regular Chrisco payments (and other similar hamper scheme arrangements) to be captured as a living expense or a commitment? | Capture as an expense.   Chrisco and other hamper schemes are like a lay\-buy as you  have to buy your goods before you get them and can cancel  the order.  In that way they are different from a credit card and buy  now pay later schemes like AfterPay and  ZipPay. |
| How do I know if a card needs to be repaid in full each month? | If the minimum payment due is equal to the closing balance, the card must be paid in full. |
| Are Layby payments to be captured as a living expense or a commitment? | Capture as an expense.   They are different from a credit card and short term buy now  pay later schemes as you have to pay for your goods in full  before you receive them.   Note: There is also a 'Buy Now Pay Later' facility name  "Laybuy" which needs to be loaded as a commitment (not an  expense). |
| When using an account statement for verification, do I need every page issued for that statement? | No  You only need the pages which: * Display the information you are verifying, and * Enable you to comply with the *Minimum Document Standards* for an  account statement |
| If a tax bill was due prior to the [Responsible Lending Start Date](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698), do I need to ask the customer if  the bill was paid or provide evidence that it was paid? | There is no requirement to make enquiries about or evidence payment of that bill, unless other application information suggests that the payment was not made (i.e the Tax bill has become a Tax debt) |
| My customer  **pre\-pays** tax expected  to be payable for the  **current** tax year. E.g. they  make PAYG Instalments. Do I need to include this as a Tax Debt? | No. Pre\-payment of tax is not considered to be a tax debt |
| The customer has advised that they don't have a tax bill or tax debt overdue. Do I need to undertake further enquiries or verification activity? | There is no requirement to undertake further verification or evidence the current status of the customer's tax payments, unless other application information suggests that the payment was not made (i.e the Tax bill has become a Tax debt) |
| Do I always need to get a statement to verify the details of the commitment and the repayment history of the account? | No, you may use a combination of documents, provided the  documents or systems used fulfil the policy  requirements.   For example, if policy requires that you verify :  1\) Loan Limit:  2\) Loan Interest Rate  3\) Loan Balance  4\) Repayment history   If the Comprehensive Credit Report (CCR) provides the limit  and repayment history only, a second document will be  required to confirm the interest rate and the balance.   If the information you need (2 and 3\) is contained on an  'account summary/extract/overview' (or any other allowable  document), policy has been satisfied and an account  statement (or any other document) is not  required |
| What happens if a commitment has been closed, but the customer is still repaying the account? | As an example this could occur where: * the customer has voluntarily cancelled a credit card but is still paying back the debt or * where the credit card has been revoked and limit cancelled by the card issuer due to poor conduct.  You need to need to verify the details of the commitment and include the repayment for serviceability calculations. |
| I noticed that prior to this loan application the  customer had been making payments to a credit card which has  not been declared.  The customer advised me that the card was closed prior to  this loan application. The Comprehensive Credit Bureau  Report (CCR) does not display the card as active, and I  can't see any payments being made to the card after this  loan application.  Do I need the customer to provide evidence that the card has  been closed? | No.   The customer has confirmed that the commitment was not in  place at the time of the loan application and there is  nothing to indicate a conflict with this information. As  such, you may accept the customer's explanation and do not  need to obtain evidence of closure.   Ensure you record the details of your discussion in  application comments. |
| How can the Bank generate a refreshed Comprehensive Credit Bureau Report (CCR) to evidence that a commitment previously on the report is now closed or has been changed (e.g. the limit has been reduced)? | Automated system rules control when the CCR is refreshed. We are unable to refresh the CCR outside of these controls. An alternate supporting document will be required to evidence the updated commitment position (closure, limit reduction etc.) if the CCR generated by the system does not reflect the closure/change |
| The Comprehensive Credit Bureau Report (CCR) shows an  existing loan facility held jointly by the borrowers on the  loan being processed.  Do I have to load this existing loan against each borrower  in ApplyOnline? | Yes.  The existing loan commitment must be included in the  serviceability assessment; this must be apportioned against  all relevant borrowers. |

 ## [1\. About this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A__About_this_policy>)


### [1\.1 Why this policy?](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Why_this_policy?>)




| Purpose | A construction loan, also known as a building loan or a  TBE (To\-Be\-Erected) loan, is a specialised lending option that  provides a borrower and their builder, funding throughout the  process of constructing or renovating a property.    This policy identifies the structure required for a home loan where  the borrowers would like to use the funds for residential building  purposes.   The loan proceeds can be used to fund the construction of one or  more residential dwellings (subject to Acceptable Security Collateral ) or  undertake home improvements (renovations) to an already established  property, where the property is also security for the proposed  loan.   The main feature is the loan proceeds are paid in progressive  payments to the builder during the construction phase. The frequency  and percentage / amount of the progress payment being advanced can  be affected by the type of security property and nature of the  building contract.   The construction can be completed by way of a Licensed Builder or an  Owner Builder. |
| --- | --- |
| Applicable to | Consumer mortgage applications where a borrower is  seeking a new loan |
| Policy exclusions | This policy does not apply to :* Bridging ICAP loan with no end debt * Loan increase * **"Turn Key****" House and Land Packages or Multi Unit Residential Developments** |
| Reading this policy | Unless specifically stipulated otherwise, the content  applies to both non\-mortgage insured (non\-MI) and mortgage insured  (MI) consumer mortgage loan applications |
| Associated policies | You may also need to refer to other lending policy  rules, including but not limited to:  * Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) * Acceptable Security Collateral * If the application requires mortgage insurance, refer to: 	+ Lenders Mortgage Insurance |




 


     

 
## [2\. Rules you must apply](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Rules_you_must_apply>)


### [2\.1 Responsibility to inform borrowers](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Lenders_responsibility_to_inform_borro>)




| For **both** Licensed Builder  (Fixed Price or Cost\-plus contracts) and Owner Builder applications,  Lenders must ensure borrowers are aware that : | * **Their own funds must be used in full prior to the release of any loan funds. R****efer :** * [*Borrower's Contribution*](#R_Borrower's_contribution) * [03\.25 Genuine Savings, Equity and Customer Contribution](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000717)  *\> 2\.3\.1 Evidencing customer contribution* |
| --- | --- |
| * Borrowers have the sole responsibility to ensure the construction complies with Local Council approval conditions and that the construction of their dwelling meets their satisfaction before submitting each request for progress payment. |
| * The Bank and / or its valuer, has no responsibility for the quality of work undertaken by the borrower's builder / contractors |
| * They are encouraged to engage an independent party (at their expense) who is suitably qualified, to monitor progress of construction. |
| * A Quantity Surveyor (QS) report may be required. Refer to   *[Quantity Surveyor (QS) reports](#R_Quantity_Surveyor_(QS)_Report)*for further  details. |
| * The first drawing is to be within 12 months of the offer date in the Terms and Conditions letter. |
| * The loan is to be fully drawn within 24 months of the offer date in the Terms and Conditions letter. |
| * The 24\-month construction term, or any longer period as  agreed by us in writing, is separate to the loan term that  commences post construction (Refer [Maximum Loan Term and Exit (Repayment) Strategy](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000680)) |
| For Licenced Builder Fixed Price Contract and Cost\-Plus  Contract **only** | * all progress payments will be paid to the builder direct and not to the borrower/s * if a building contract is varied after loan drawdown/s have  commenced and: 	+ upgrades are made, then the customers must ensure that they have access to sufficient funds to pay for any increase in the cost of construction. For example the borrower wants to substitute a more expensive type of tap wear. 	+ down\-grades are made, then the customers must notify the Bank as the variations to the contract may impact the valuation of the property. For example original building contract included ducted air\-conditioning and the customers ask the builder to not proceed with purchase and installation of the air\-conditioning |
| For Owner Builders **only** | * **funding in advance is  [not](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>)** **available**. Funds are  released against the cost to complete as advised by the  Bank’s panel valuer. Release of funds is based on the  items being affixed to the site. E.g. The borrower wishes to  purchase the bricks ready to construct the walls. Payment  can only be made after the bricks are affixed in place. * For any variation to cost estimates after the Loan’s first advance, borrower/s should ensure they have sufficient funds to cover the difference from the original contract (where there is an increase in costs to construct) * The panel valuer may request additional documentation to support the 'Construction' valuation and this will be set out in the valuation report. This may include: * [a](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>) *Quantity Surveyor (QS) reports* * Engineer's details re slab / footings * Pest treatment or pest prevention confirmation * Roof truss details from manufacturer * for properties located in NSW: * Before the final progress payment the Bank requires a copy of the updated Survey Report showing the position of the improvements in relation to the boundaries, and that all improvements comply with the Local Government Ordinances (The survey should be updated after completion of eaves and guttering) or a copy of the Certificate of Occupancy. Prior to the first progress payment the Bank may request to sight the survey report showing the location of the footings / slab (or the pegged out survey) * In all cases the Broker is to ascertain the borrower/s experience and background to undertake the construction and provide notes in their submission accordingly. Lender/Broker is to comment on any large variations between Owner Builder cost estimate and Panel Valuer check costs shown on the valuation report. * Check costs are the Valuer's estimates of the cost of the project under contract builder conditions. There should be a demonstrable cost benefit for the Owner builder project v's completing the transaction via a Licensed builder. |
| For Kit Home applications | * the Bank will [not](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>) advance any  funds for purchase or delivery of the kit against value of  the (unassembled) kit or, offsite construction costs. |


     

  

  
 ### [2\.2 Unacceptable Building Types](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Unacceptable_Building_Types>)




| * [Split Contract](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000723#S) constructions (both single  residential and multi\-unit residential developments) are not  permitted. |
| --- |
| * Kit homes where funding of the kit is required up front or prior to instillation |
| * Transportable homes where funding of the dwelling is required prior to the dwelling being transported, fixed on site, and all services connected. |
| * Owner builder loans where funding are in advance (refer   [*Owner Builder* )](#R_Owner_Builder) |
| * Any home proposed to be built from unconventional building materials. Example Mud Brick, straw bale, polystyrene, log cabin. |
| Refer to [Loan to Value Ratio (LVR)](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000684) and the [Acceptable Security Collateral](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000682) policies for further  information. |


   

 ### [2\.3 Acceptable Building Types \- Definition](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Acceptable_Building_Types>)




| **Acceptable Building Types** | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| * Licensed Builder \- Fixed Price Contract | A fixed price contract is where the customer and the  Licensed Builder agree to a set price for the cost of building a  home or undertaking renovations prior to commencing any building  work.  * If the contract is not a fixed price building contract,  refer to  [Cost\-Plus Contracts](#Acceptable - Licensed Builder Cost - Plus (Non-fixed price) contract) * If a borrower is constructing with a house / land package  refer to  [House / land Packages Deals](#Acceptable - House / land package)  for further  information. |
| * Licensed Builder Cost \- Plus (Non\-fixed price) contract | Cost plus contracts can be identified because they do  not state the total cost of the build and may only provide a  'budgeted cost to complete', 'Cost plus a percentage' or may show  the cost of the works plus allow a margin for labour or even  building material cost increases.   The amount due to the builder is the actual cost incurred by the  contractor plus a percentage or the cost incurred plus an hourly  rate for the contractor.   As materials are not a fixed price, the overall cost of the contract  can vary. This can result in a significant increase in the contract  price prior to/or during construction and therefore may adversely  affect the Bank's lending and security position. |
| * Owner Builder | The Bank will treat the following application and  borrower types as Owner Builders:  * Anyone who takes on the responsibility of managing their own residential building project. This includes where the borrower(s) takes on the tasks of coordinating and contracting roles usually undertaken by an architect or builder, regardless if they do or do not hold qualifications in the building industry or related trades (e.g. electrician, plumber). * Any portion of the construction is carried out by the owner * The borrower(s) are Directors / Proprietors of the entity undertaking the construction     Exception : If the entity is a Pty Ltd company (PLC) and,   * there is a standard fixed price building contract between PLC as the builder and the borrower as the customer, * [refer to](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>)  [Licensed builder fixed price contract](#Acceptable - Licensed Builder - Fixed Price Contract)  or  [Licensed builder Cost\-plus contract](#Acceptable - Licensed Builder Cost - Plus (Non-fixed price) contract) ) * [Kit Homes](#Acceptable - Kit Homes)  (even where the construction is completed  by an unrelated licensed builder contract) |
| * Renovation / Home Improvement loans | A renovation to an established residential property can  be completed by way of a Licensed Builder, Owner Builder or using  multiple external tradespeople and will be assessed according to  builder type and value of construction.   In some cases we may be able to release equity against the current  value of an existing property, refer to ' [*Progress payments not required*'](#R_Progress_Payments_not_required)  for eligibility criteria.   Where the 'TBE' (To Be Erected) value is to be relied upon for  security value and the Bank requires progress payments, then:  * the Bank must control the release of funds to ensure the  renovations / Home Improvements work is completed,  **and** * all quotations from all subcontractors (including proposed finishes and specifications) must be provided to the Bank prior to ordering the full valuation report (Construction long form or Construction short form valuation). |
| * [Kit Homes](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#Acceptable - Kit Homes>) | A construction option wherein most of the components of  the home are prefabricated and are brought to the site / location of  construction where it is assembled.   A Kit Home can be either:  * Wholly or partially constructed offsite (i.e. in manufacturer's premises to a specific stage) then delivered to borrower's land for affixing to the borrower's land; or * All building materials necessary to construct the home are delivered to the borrower’s land for constructing on site. |
| * Multiple Dwellings | Residential building loans where more than one dwelling  is being constructed i.e. duplex, townhouses or units are considered  to be multiple dwelling developments. |
| * Transportable Homes | Transportable homes are defined as:  * A dwelling transported to site and permanently affixed in place. * Require connection to services (e.g. water, gas, electricity, sewerage). * Is not able to be easily moved again. * Is not to be confused with a relocatable home, which is not acceptable for bank lending purposes. |
| * House / land package | Standard house and land package  Borrowers choose a block of land and house from a range of building  plan options offered by the builder. Borrowers may have a  choice of builders if the land is being purchased from a developer.  The builder may be completing additional items like  air\-conditioning, carpeting, landscaping etc. When determining the  market value on a 'To be Erected (TBE)' basis, the valuation  will reflect separate values for the land and improvements.  **"Turn Key"** **House and Land Packages or Multi Unit Residential Developments**   With a "Turn Key" style house and land package the property is  purchased as one parcel and contracts can be entered into for the  purchase either on completion of the home before construction  commences or once construction is complete.   The borrower is not able to choose their own builder and settlement  does not take place until after completion of construction. |

 ### [2\.5 Additional building work outside of the primary builder's fixed price contract](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Additional_building_work_outside_of_th>)


A Licensed Builder's fixed price contract may incorporate the
 completion of all required building work. However, it is acceptable for
 the applicant to provide separate contracts or quotes for additional
 work to be completed as a part of the loan application.  

  

 If these works are being funded by the Bank and the valuer has
 considered these improvements when arriving at a 'TBE' (To Be Erected)
 valuation figure of the property, the Bank must control funds to ensure
 this work is completed.  

  

 The following items are examples of additional works which may be
 completed by an external contractor other than the primary builder:
 
* Air conditioning
* Carpets
* Curtains
* Driveways
* Fences
* Flooring
* Landscaping
* Paving
* Pergolas
* Security System
* Swimming Pool
* Window furnishing

 ### [2\.7 Borrower's contribution](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Borrower's_contribution>)




| The borrower's contribution must always be fully utilised towards the construction before any progress payments commence | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owner Builder | Transportable | All Other |
| [Funding in advance is](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>) [not](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>) available. The Bank  will not advance funds for work yet to be completed but  will only reimburse Owner Builders for work completed.  **This means borrowers need to hold sufficient funds to allow them to cover the most expensive stage of construction**.  The cost of the most expensive stage may be greater than the difference between the Owner Builder cash flow statement and loan amount. Evidence of Borrower contribution held in a savings account is required prior to the Bank issuing a Builders Pack. | In determining the borrowers contribution, consider the difference between the loan amount and costs related to the purchase of the \`house'. For a transportable this may also include the costs of transportation, transit insurance and site fixing. | Where the loan amount applied for / approved, is less than or equal to the costs/tender (including quotes), borrowers will be required to have the difference between the tender / contract and loan amount available in a savings account, prior to or concurrent with the Bank authorising commencement of construction. |
| Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security collateral When a shortfall is identified by the Progress Payments Team, the Lender/Broker will be advised and are required to address before loan funds can be drawn. The calculation used to identify a shortfall is as follows:* Borrower’s Contribution \+ Loan Amount (less any fees) is less than the Building Price.  The Building price includes the contract plus any additional quotes used to achieve the ‘To Be Erected (TBE)’ valuation figure.   Following this assessment of the borrower/s’ position, the Broker must notify the Progress Payments team of the outcome, so that an amended schedule can be issued. | | |



 

  

 ### [2\.8 Changes to council approved or privately certified plans](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Changes_to_council_approved_or_private>)


Before the borrower makes any changes to council approved plans,
 they must inform the Bank and obtain consent. If there are changes, such
 as to the structure or the projected costing, details must be provided
 in writing.  

  

 A Construction Valuation (short form or long form) is required to
 confirm the property's value against the new (amended) Council Approved
 Plans and Specifications.  

  

 Subject to the nature of the change the application may need to be
 re\-assessed and a new approval issued (including new loan offer
 documents and progress payment schedules).  The re\-assessment is
 required to ensure the transaction, security and resulting LVR remain
 acceptable to the Bank.

 ### [2\.10 Progress Payments](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Progress_Payments>)




| Definition | Refer  [03\.28 Glossary](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000723) |
| --- | --- |
| Conditions | * All required documentation is to be received by the Bank at the appropriate stages for the loan and progress payments to be drawn. * Any shortfall of funds ([*Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security*  collateral)](#Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security collateral)  will require Lender/Broker follow  up. The Lender/Broker will need to evidence the borrower has  sufficient funds to complete and send a confirmation email  to the Progress Payments Team. * The Progress Payments Team must have issued a Builders Pack. This occurs once the certificate of title has been certified, settlement requirements have been met and there is no evidence of shortfall. * A Progress Inspection Report may be requested from the  original valuer. Refer to  [Progress Inspections](#R_Progress_Inspections) * Process : Refer to  [Process  \> *Progress Payments*](#P_Progress_Payments) . |
| Owner Builder | * Owner Builder progress payment stages are not  pre\-determined. * When the borrower requests a progress payment, an inspection  by the Bank's panel valuer is required to determine the  value of the work completed to date, prior to any payment  being released.   At all times, sufficient loan funds are retained to ensure  practical completion of the dwelling based on the owner  builder's original cost to complete and valuer's assessment  of completed work. * Assessment is based only on works completed / materials fixed to site, and not materials purchased or delivered to site. For example the Owner Builder may have just completed the pouring of the slab and request the first progress payment. In addition they have purchased the bricks and roof tiles and had them delivered to the construction site. The Bank will only reimburse the customer for the slab because the bricks and roof tiles have not been installed and are not fixed to site. |
| Licensed Builder contracts – Standard Schedule of payments | Progress payment schedules are considered to be 'Standard' where the valuer makes a comment within the valuation commentary to indicate they are 'to industry standard', or makes no comment. |
| Licensed Builder contracts – Non\-Standard Schedule of payments | If the valuer comments the schedule of payments are  'not to industry standard', then **you must** request a  new schedule of payments from the Builder **when the below conditions apply**:  * The schedule already held does not meet the  [table 1](#Progress Payment Stage)   below and: 	+ The application is Mortgage Insured; or 	+ The application is Non\-mortgage insured loan 	 **with any risk rating ≥ 4**  [No action is required when the valuer comments 'not to industry standard' but the above conditions are not triggered.](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>)   When required to obtain a new schedule of payments, all of the below  applies:  * They must correspond with the completion basic stages of  construction, which can be: 	+ Deposit 	+ Foundations 	+ Frame 	+ External Lining 	+ Lockup / Internal Lining 	+ Practical Completion * The schedule of payments must comply with the below table:    | [Progress Payment Stage](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#Progress Payment Stage>) | % of Contract | | --- | --- | | Maximum at Foundation Stage (including deposit) | 20 | | Minimum at Practical Completion Stage | 10 | | **Other individual stages limited to** | ≤ 35 | | All Stages must total | 100 |   [The above table ensures that a builder allocates the appropriate level of funds at each stage of the build, ensuring the construction is completed.](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>)   The application **must not** proceed to formal approval  until a compliant schedule of payments is held. |

 ### [2\.12 Quantity Surveyor (QS) Report](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Quantity_Surveyor_(QS)_Report>)




| Definition of a QS | A professional who specialises in the field of construction and  property development, with the primary responsibility to accurately  estimate the costs associated with construction projects, from the  initial planning stages to the final completion. |
| --- | --- |
| When is a QS report required? | For all Acceptable Building Types, the Valuer at their discretion  may request a QS report. **Note: when the valuer has requested a QS report, this cannot be waived.**    Common instances when this may occur include (but are not limited  to):  * Owner builder constructions * Building sites with complexities (e.g., site access complication, steeply sloping environmental issues / flooding). * High build cost per square metre * Building contracts with non\-industry standard progress  schedules e.g. 	+ A progress schedule that is time based (e.g., monthly payments to the builder that do not relate to work completed) 	+ A progress schedule that requires payments to be paid, for partially completed works / stages. * Constructions with unusual designs (e.g. where valuer has  few peers in the building market to draw reasonable rate  cost conclusions). For further information as to what is  considered 'unusual' refer to  [Assessing Security Collateral](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000686)  \> rules you  must apply \> *Assessing security requirements \- standard real estate* \> Residential dwelling to  be erected. |
| **Who pays for a QS report?** | A QS is to be engaged and paid for by the borrower/s in all  instances. This includes the QS report at the initial TBE Valuation  and at all Progress Inspection stages. |
| **Conditions** | * The QS engaged by the borrower/s must be a member of  [Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors](http://www.aiqs.com.au/) . * Whenever a progress payment is requested, if the valuer requires a QS report, the customer must provide this to the bank.    A QS Report must include:   * The cost benefit of completing the construction on an owner builder basis. * The total cost to complete the project. * The site stages must add up to the total cost of the project.    The QS Report provided at progress inspections is to cover:  * Evidence that work completed is according to industry standards. * Cost of work completed to date. * A comparison with original costing.    When the QS report has been provided, the broker / assessor must  archive a copy with the loan file and provide a copy to the  valuer. |
| Additional Conditions | If Mortgage Operations identifies that the cost to complete  the project on the QS report exceeds the building contract or  remaining undrawn loan balance, the application will be  referred to the Broker to confirm how any additional costs will  be met. Refer to  [insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security collateral](#Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security collateral) . |


  

 
### **[2\.13 Settlement period \- building loans](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Settlement_period_-_building_loans>)**


'Settlement' for all building loans is defined as the first draw
 down (i.e. for land settlement) or where no initial draw is to occur,
 satisfactory completion of all the Bank's legal requirements to register
 a mortgage over the land and funds are ready to be made available.  

  

 For Construction Loans (Contract Builder/Owner Builder):
 
* Initial draw down is to occur within 12 months of the Loan offer date and;
* Completion of construction and/or final progress payment is to be made
 within twenty four (24\) month of the loan offer date

| 2 | Identify the  **minimum** document  standards for the document type | Refer to [Minimum Document Standards Table](#Minimum Document Standards Table) * Locate the document type * Cross reference the verification activity being performed (e.g. Income)  The table details the  **minimum** **standards** for each document  type according to the verification activity being  performed   Where the minimum standards vary for different verification  policies, refer to the 'in all cases' row and the 'when used  for' row (for specific  policy) |
| 3 | Identify any **additional requirements**  for the document type  (above the minimum document standards) | Individual policy rules may require the supporting  document to display information **in addition** to the  **minimum**  standards   Refer to the relevant section of policy for the verification  activity being performed, for example: * [Maximum Loan Term and Exit (Repayment) Strategy](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000680) * *[Commitments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690)* * [Genuine savings, Equity and Customer Contribution](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000717) * Self\-employed applicants * *[Verifying income](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000721)* * [Loan Application and Approval \> Validation of information provided by the customer](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698)  Specific policy chapters will detail any additional  requirements for the document type.  **Note:**  Mortgage Insurers and Credit may also request additional  requirements above the minimum standards |


  

   
 ### [2\.2 Maximum age of documents](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Maximum_age_of_documents>)


'Maximum Age' refers to the maximum period that can elapse between the date the document was produced to the  ‘Responsible Lending Start Date’.  Refer to [Loan Application and Approval](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698)  \> Responsible Lending Start
 Date .  

 Refer to the  [Minimum Document Standards Table](#Minimum Document Standards Table)  to determine the maximum allowable age for a
 document.  

Where a series of documents is required (e.g. 2 payslips) the most
 recent is to be dated within the limit described in **Maximum age**  

  

The below definitions can be used to calculate if the document meets the
 maximum age.  

   


| Maximum Age | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 Month | * The first day of the month up to and including the last day  of the same month (e.g. 1/1/2018 to 31/1/2018\)  **or** * Any day in the first month up to and including one day prior in the next month (e.g. 15/1/2018 to 14/2/2018\) |
| 2 Months | * The first day of the month up to and including the last day  of the following month (e.g. 1/1/2018 to 28/2/2018\)  **or** * Any day in the first (given) month up to and including one day prior in the following second month (e.g. 15/1/2018 to 14/3/2018\) |
| The same methodology may be extrapolated out to any  higher number of months | |


     

  
 ### [2\.3 Acceptable and unacceptable document formats, delivery methods and suppliers](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Acceptable_document_formats,_delivery_>)


The table below specifies the various accepted and unaccepted document
 formats and the delivery methods by which they may be provided to the
 Bank.  

   


| Document format | Acceptable | Unacceptable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Standalone document** Including but not limited to: * Physical document * Image/photograph/screen shot * PDF | * Physical document * Facsimile * Attached or embedded within an email * Obtained via a portal (such as Proviso or Mogo)\-Brokers only | * Documents provided via text message (SMS) * An image or photograph of document taken by a Lender (internal staff or Broker) as this is not secure in the event the device is lost or stolen. * Handwritten documents, except where: 	+ The [Minimum Document Standards Table](#Minimum Document Standards Table) 	 specifies 'can be 	 handwritten'; 	or 	+ The document is a template form which has been completed by hand |
| Written text within the body of an email | Email, which has: * been emailed directly to the Broker by the issuer, and * been emailed from the issuer's email system | * A document type of 'Email advice' (a document in the form of text written in the body of an email), which 	+ **Has not** 	 been emailed directly to 	 the lender by the 	 issuer, 	 and/or; 	+ **Has** been emailed from a public email address (e.g. gmail) |
| **Internally sourced document** Refers to a document sourced from internal systems by an  internal staff  member | Sourced internally |  |
| Subject to individual policies, the below may be  permitted to supply the document to the broker:  * the applicant * the document issuer * the applicant's accountant * internally supplied | | |


  

  Refer to the [Minimum Document Standards Table](#Minimum Document Standards Table) to determine: 
* The acceptable document format for each document type
* The acceptable supplier for each document type


### **[2\.4 Using a combination of documents to complete verification](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.4 Using a combination of documents to complete verification>)**


 It is acceptable to use either a single supporting document, or a combination of
 documents to complete verification activities for the following policies:

 * Verifying Income
* [Commitments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690) \*


    

\*  **Note:** Includes the following non\-discretionary expense types:

 * outgoing child support (maintenance) payments
* outgoing alimony (spousal support)
* outgoing rent / board


    

 Where a combination of documents is used, a document override code will **not** be required to be entered where the below are met:

 * A clear link can be established between each document
 provided (e.g. account number matched on each document);
 **and**
* The combined documents display **all** of
 the mandatory to verify requirements as specified for
 the verification activity being completed and documented
 in:
	+ Verifying Income
	+ Commitments
	+ [Minimum Document
	 Standards Table](#Minimum Document Standards Table)


 Where policy requires the verification document to include both the account holder
 name and account number / identifier, and the primary document does not display
 both, then a second verification document is required to link the primary document
 to the applicant. The maximum age of the ‘linking’ document is 12 months from the
 Responsible Lending start date.  

  

 Examples of acceptable document combinations include, but are not limited to the
 following:
 * **Commitment verification** – a transaction summary is
 provided which displays the account number but not the account
 holder’s name.  If used in isolation, the transaction
 summary does not meet document standards. A second supporting
 document, such as an account statement (that may not meet the
 maximum age of document requirements for that document) may be
 obtained to connect the transaction summary to the
 applicant.
* **Income verification** – a payslip does
 not detail the period the payslip covers, however an
 internal system extract confirms the applicant is paid
 weekly. The internal system extract can be used as the
 second supporting
 document.


    

 Where the combination of documents supplied do not include all of the mandatory
 information required to enable the verification activity to be completed, lenders /
 assessors must obtain an alternate acceptable document.  

  

 If no other acceptable document is available , the broker / assessor may refer the
 application to Credit for consideration, where supported by strong mitigants and
 justification within application comments.  

  
 ### [2\.5 When supporting documents are not in in English or display a currency other than AUD](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.4 When supporting documents are not in in English or display a currency other than AUD>)


 In all cases where the supporting documents are not in English **or** a currency
 other than Australian dollars (AUD) is displayed on the document, the  [Foreign](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/ci/okcsFattach/getFile/1000702/03.13%20Translation%20Checklist%20CSH.xlsm)   [currency translation checklist](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/ci/okcsFattach/getFile/1000702/03.13%20Translation%20Checklist%20CSH.xlsm) is to be completed.  

    

 Where the supporting documents are in a language other than English:
 * The applicant is to supply both the original document and an English translation prepared by an accredited translator at their own cost.
* The translated document is to be stamped with translators NAATI stamp


  

 Translation of documents by either a Westpac Group staff member **or** a Westpac
 Group Finance Broker is not permitted. Refer   [https://www.naati.com.au/\#](https://www.naati.com.au/)   for a list of translators in your local area (click on the
 "online directory").  

 

  

   


### [2\.6 Name variations](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Name_variations>)


The names of borrowers and guarantors must be correct in
 ApplyOnline.  

    

 Where a verification document(s) shows a name mismatch to the loan origination
 system, policy allows minor name variations to be accepted without referring to
 Credit or applying an override.  

  

 The tables below list a number of acceptable name variation scenarios / examples and
 are intended as a guide only, i.e. they should not be taken as the only allowable
 scenarios / examples.

## [1\. About this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_About_this_policy>)


### [1\.1 Definition of a borrower](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Definition_of_a_borrower>)


Borrowers / applicants are individual / natural person(s)
 **and** non\-natural entities that are eligible to access
 the suite of Residential Lending Products (consumer mortgage products)
 assessed under Consumer Lending Policies.  

   
### [1\.2 What is the loan purpose?](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_What_is_the_loan_purpose?>)


The loan purpose indicates the reason why a borrower is applying for a loan. The purpose of the loan is used to make a decision on the borrower’s suitability, eligibility, the risk associated with the transaction as well as setting the appropriate pricing for the loan.  

Note loan purpose and borrower type also determines whether the
 National Credit Code (NCC) applies.    

  
### [1\.2\.1 Why this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Why_this_policy>)


The purpose of this policy is to provide an overview of: 
* The acceptable borrowers for Consumer Mortgage loans
* The acceptable loan purposes for Consumer Mortgage loans
* Co\-Borrowers eligibility requirements for Consumer Mortgage loans


Loans may be made available to existing customers or non\-customers provided they can meet Bank eligibility criteria and the loan is deemed not unsuitable. Applicants need to demonstrate: 
* The legal capacity to enter into a Credit Contract. (Bank policy requires that the minimum age of an applicant must be 18 years).
* A satisfactory financial position for age/income with the ability to meet
 all existing and proposed commitments in accordance with the Bank's debt
 servicing criteria without enduring financial hardship.
	+ - It is contrary to credit policy to add a borrower to any loan facility to increase servicing / borrowing power.
		- Furthermore, guarantor income **may not** be added to borrower income when
		 assessing servicing capacity, except where
		 permitted under [Guarantees](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000696)
		*policy*.
* If they are a co\-borrower, that they are receiving a substantial benefit
 from the loan transaction \- refer [Co\-borrower eligibility requirements](#R_Co-borrower_eligibility_requirements).


* A satisfactory credit history.
* Stability in employment with a regular, predictable and verifiable income source.
* Stable residency or mobility through employment (e.g. teacher, police officer etc.)
* They are not aware of any significant changes to their financial situation over the next 3 years that would adversely impact their ability to meet loan repayments. If a customer indicates that they are aware of adverse changes that may impact their ability to make repayments the loan must be referred to the Credit Team with details of the change, the expected impact, and any mitigating circumstances that Credit should consider when reviewing the application.


You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to: 
* *[Lending to Non\-Australian Citizens](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000702)*
* Serviceability Assessment
* [Commitments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690)

## [2\. Rules you must apply](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Rules_you_must_apply>)


### [2\.1 Identifying the borrower](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Identifying_the_borrower>)


All borrowers/applicants must be identified before any loan application is processed. Under no circumstances can an account be opened (including any loan account) without the required identification.   

You must confirm the applicant’s residency status as specific
 policy rules may apply to your individual applicant. For further
 information refer [Australian citizen residency status](#2.3 Australian citizen residency status) and  [Lending to Non\-Australian Citizens](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000702) .  

Where the applicant is an existing WBC / SGB / BoM / BSA customer and has an existing Relationship Manager, the application must be referred to the Relationship Manager for assessment.  Refer to *Eligibility \> Process to follow \>*   *Identifying a business banking client*  .    

     

  
 ### [2\.2 Eligible Borrowers for a Consumer Mortgage Loan](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Eligible_Borrowers>)

 ### [2\.4 Customers Experiencing Vulnerability](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Customers_Experiencing_Vulnerability>)


When interviewing a customer or processing a consumer mortgage loan application, you must take extra care: 
* If you notice a vulnerability
* if a vulnerability is disclosed to your


Customer vulnerability refers to customers in circumstances which
 make them more susceptible to harm, loss, or disadvantage (either
 personal or financial) than a person not in those circumstances. This
 means that they may require extra care to help them achieve a similar
 service outcome to someone who is not in vulnerable circumstances.  

  

**Vulnerable customers include those experiencing:**  

A. Age\-related impairment.  

 B. Cognitive impairment.  

 C. Elder abuse.  

 D. Family or domestic violence.  

 E. Financial abuse.  

 F. Mental illness or mental health problems.  

 G. Serious illness and severe or long\-term illness.  

 H. Gambling  

 I. Scams  

 J. any other identifiable personal, or financial, circumstance causing
 significant detriment    

  

 There are many types of vulnerability and learning a catalogue of
 circumstances may not always be helpful. Be alert to recognise the potential
 signs of someone experiencing vulnerable circumstances and use the extra
 care mindset: 
* Act with Sensitivity
* Act with Compassion
* Act with Respect


It is with that extra care mindset, that Brokers are to ensure all borrowers and guarantors fully understand the commitment they are entering into.   

  
 

| Vulnerability category | Loan processing guidance |
| --- | --- |
| * A. Age\-related impairment. | * Only proceed with the loan application provided there are no other vulnerable categories evident that would prevent the loan from proceeding. * Ensure all other policy parameters are met, e.g. *[Maximum Loan Term and Exit (Repayment) Strategy](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000680).* |
| * B. Cognitive impairment.  Cognitive impairment is not an illness, but a description of someone's condition. It means they may have trouble with things like memory, paying attention or have trouble speaking or understanding. Having difficulty recognising people, places or things. They may find new things or situations overwhelming. For the Bank’s process purposes, cognitive impairment will include customers with an intellectual disability, | * Where the cognitive impairment is serious (i.e. where the customer does not have legal capacity), do not proceed with the loan application unless a Court appointed guardian, administrator or an enduring Power of Attorney (appointed prior to the loss of capacity), is present. * For any other minor or temporary impairment, ensure a  suitable support person, such as a family member nominated  by the customer (who is not a staff member of the Westpac  Group), is present.     **Note:** A suitable support  person cannot be a co\-borrower or a person who would be set  to receive any benefit under the loan facility. * Only proceed with the loan application provided there are no other vulnerable categories evident that would prevent the loan from proceeding. * Referral to credit is mandatory to ensure all borrowers will receive an adequate direct benefit and to ensure the loan is documented correctly.  Note: There are only very limited circumstances that a loan application should proceed where a borrower is suffering from cognitive impairment. Extreme care should be taken to ensure the loan is for the borrower’s benefit e.g. bridging loan to assist with move to nursing care until sale of owner\-occupied home. |
| * C. Elder abuse. | * If the borrower or guarantor appear to be under coercion, including because of their vulnerable circumstances, the loan application should not proceed. |
| * D. Family or domestic violence. | * If the borrower or guarantor appear to be under coercion, including because of their vulnerable circumstances, the loan application should not proceed. |
| * E. Financial abuse. | * If the borrower or guarantor appear to be under coercion, including because of their vulnerable circumstances, the loan application should not proceed. |
| * F. Mental illness or mental health problems.  For the Bank’s process purposes mental illness or mental health problems will include customers with depression or anxiety. | * Ensure all borrowers / guarantors understand the loan and are not under any coercion. If the borrower or guarantor appear to be under coercion, including because of their vulnerable circumstances, the loan application should not proceed.  Note: There are only very limited circumstances that a loan application should proceed where a borrower is suffering from mental illness or mental health problems. Extreme care should be taken to ensure the loan is for the borrower’s benefit. |
| * G. Serious illness and severe or long\-term illness. | * Only proceed with the loan application provided there are no other vulnerable categories evident that would prevent the loan from proceeding.    **Note:** There are  only very limited circumstances that a loan application  should proceed where a borrower is suffering from serious  illness or long term illness. Extreme care should be taken  to ensure the loan is for the borrower’s benefit. Ensure the  income used to service the loan is sustainable and that the  loan term is suitable. Also ensure the any expected  significant changes to financial circumstances have been  adequately addressed. |
| * H. Gambling | * There are only very limited circumstances that a loan application should proceed where a borrower is suffering from a gambling addiction. Extreme care should be taken to ensure * The loan requested is not for further gambling * Any co\-borrower will receive a [substantial benefit](#R_Substantial_benefit_test) * Any guarantor has sought independent legal advice and  has  been provided with the required documents outlined  in *[Guarantees](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000696)\>Accepting  a guarantee – 3 day requirement* * The gambling has been loaded as an expense and included within the loan serviceability assessment. |
| * I. Scams | * If it is evident that the borrower is being scammed and the loan being applied for relates to the scam, the application should not proceed. |
| * J. Any other personal, or financial, circumstance causing significant detriment | * Only proceed with the loan application provided there are no vulnerable categories evident that would prevent the loan from proceeding. |


  

     

**When to take application notes:**  

  

The needs of a vulnerable customer must be considered prior to submitting an application. Unless it’s directly related to the Suitability Assessment under Responsible Lending obligation, Brokers must not make records about a customer’s potential or actual vulnerability as this may be a breach of the customers privacy.  

    

If the customer's vulnerability impacts the [Suitability Assessment under Responsible Lending](#R_Suitability_Assessment_under_Responsib) obligation, Brokers
 must enter notes in ApplyOnline to provide a justification for
 the loan to proceed under Responsible Lending laws, regardless of
 whether the customer provides explicit consent. Similarly, you do not
 need to request consent to record notes when the information directly
 relates to the applicant(s)’ financial ability to service the new loan
 application.  

    

Notes on vulnerability for the Suitability Assessment must: 
* Be factual only
* Not express an opinion or be defamatory
* Limit information to what is absolutely necessary to satisfy the [Suitability Assessment Responsible Lending](#R_Suitability_Assessment_under_Responsib) obligation.


  

Where a customer requests the vulnerability information not be recorded and this is directly relevant to the Suitability Assessment or their financial ability to service the loan, the application must not commence.  

    

Should a customer tell you they are in vulnerable circumstances and need assistance, please contact the Broker Hotline to advise that the customer is in a vulnerable circumstance and requires extra care, so that extra care can be provided.
### **2\.5 Co\-borrower eligibility requirements**


#### [2\.5\.1 Banking Code of Practice (BCoP)](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Banking_Code_of_Practice_(BCoP)>)


In compliance with the Banking Code of Practice (BCoP), we will not approve an individual as a co\-borrower on a loan unless they will receive a *substantial benefit* from that loan.  

  

A loan should not be structured as a co\-borrower loan where the customer is better suited to be a guarantor simply to enable processing.  

Where it appears that a co\-borrower is experiencing financial abuse, the application must not be submitted for assessment as a co\-borrower loan.   

  

Also refer to *‘[Customers Experiencing Vulnerability'](#R_Customers_Experiencing_Vulnerability)* 
#### [2\.5\.2 Substantial benefit test](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Substantial_benefit_test>)


A substantial benefit requires that each co\-borrower must get a real and tangible benefit arising out of the underlying transaction. That is, where there are 2 or more co\-borrowers:
* Each co\-borrower has a direct legal or equitable
 ownership interest of at least 30%\* in the asset
 (i.e. property) being purchased with the loan funds,
 or
* At least 30%\* of the loan funds will be
 used to repay or refinance debts or other obligations in
 each co\-borrower’s name.


\*If there are more than two co\-borrowers, or the
 co\-borrowers have different levels of ownership, then the percentage
 figure may be reasonably adjusted. For example, 4 co\-borrowers could be
 25% each. If the minimum percentage is not met, consider whether the
 applicant who is not receiving a substantial benefit from the loan is
 better protected under a guarantor structure.  

  

In meeting the banks R\&O requirements to determine a borrowers Substantial Benefit, brokers must:
* **Enquire of the borrowers how the loan funds
 will be used and ensure the percentage of loan funds
 used meets the policy minimum:
 *and***
* Record in the loan origination system, details of the customer’s response and the reasons why both borrowers will receive a substantial benefit.


The substantial benefit requirement is to be satisfied on the information the customer has provided us during the loan application.   

  

In addition, further clarification must be sought from the customer if the information they provide conflicts with any other information disclosed in the application.  

 


| Scenarios where substantial benefit is met | |
| --- | --- |
| Sample lending scenario | **Explanation** |
| * Co\-borrowers are purchasing a new property, which they will  own as **joint tenants**1 | * As joint tenants, they each have an equal share in the property and the substantial benefit test is met.(e.g satisfies the requirement that each borrower must have at least 30% ownership in the security property being purchased) |
| * Co\-borrowers are purchasing a new property, which they will  own as **tenants in common**2 in a 60%/40%  share. | * Substantial benefit test is met as each co\-borrower will own at least 30% share in the property. |
| * Co\-borrowers apply to  **refinance** their existing home  loan \[currently with another bank] which is in both names. | * Substantial benefit test is met as the loan funds will be used to repay the existing joint debt. |
| * Co\-borrowers have an existing home loan with us, and they  apply to access some of the equity in their property (i.e.  **cash out**) | * **Ask the customers what they wish to use the funds for**. Even if there are  multiple purposes, apply the substantial benefit test to the  total value of the transaction. * If at least 30% of the funds will be used for the benefit of both co\-borrowers, i.e. to refurbish the security property or to purchase a car they will both have access to, then the substantial benefit test is met. * If the funds are to be used to purchase shares to be held in  one co\-borrower’s name only, then substantial benefit test  is not met. However, an *[exception](#R_Substantial_benefit_test)*below may apply. |
| * Co\-borrowers have applied for a loan for $600,000\.  Loan funds to be used for multiple  purposes:     1. To purchase an investment property for $500,000 and 1. To pay out a personal loan in one co\-borrowers name of $100,000 | * Ownership in the property being purchased will be 60% to one borrower and 40% to the other co\-borrower * One co\-borrower has the benefit of $200,000 interest in the investment property (which is 33\.33% of the requested loan amount). The other co\-borrower has the benefit of $400,000 ($300,000 interest in the investment property \+ $100,000 to pay out personal loan which is 66\.66% of the requested loan amount). Note: Both co\-borrowers must have a benefit of at least 30% of the $600,000 loan, for the substantial benefit test to be met. |
| * Co\-borrowers have an existing home loan with us, and they  apply for a **top up** of their  home loan to purchase a car for their child. | * Substantial benefit test is met because one co\-borrower is receiving the same benefit relative to the other’s benefit. |
| Note 1\. 1Joint  tenants both have equal ownership of and interest in the  property. In the event that one joint tenant dies, their  interest in the property passes to the surviving joint  tenant. 2 Tenants in common each own a  defined share in a property. They may sell their share  in the property to another person if they wish. In the  event that one tenant in common dies, their share of the  property becomes part of their deceased  estate. | |

### [1\.2 What is a guarantee?](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_What_is_a_guarantee?>)


 A guarantee is a contractual promise given by a third party, i.e. the guarantor, who agrees, that in the event the customers are unable or unwilling to repay the loan, the guarantor is liable for the amount of the limited guarantee.  

  

 
### [1\.3 National Credit Code and Banking Code of Practice](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Background_-_Guarantees>)


 The National Credit Code (NCC) and the Banking Code of Practice
 (BCoP) provide protections to individuals who enter into a guarantee as security for
 a loan.  

 For details of the Banking Code of Practice requirements relating to
 Guarantees, refer to:
 * Banking Code of Practice (BCoP)


 Also refer to:

 * Independent legal advice
* Guarantee amount\-NCC and BCoP


In all instances, prospective guarantors are to be informed that they need to make any appropriate enquiries about the credit worthiness, financial position and integrity of the borrowers. This should be pointed out at application and again at approval. (The prospective guarantors are reminded of this prior to signing the Guarantee and Indemnity.)  

  
 ## [2\. Rules you must apply](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Rules_you_must_apply>)


### [2\.1 Guarantee types and guarantors](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Guarantee_types_and_guarantors>)


For Consumer Lending policy, the Bank requires a guarantor to be an individual. An entity cannot be a guarantor.  

  

 The ‘Policy rules per guarantee type' tables specify:
 * and define the acceptable guarantee types and acceptable guarantors. Acceptability is also subject to:
	+ appropriate assessment of the borrower and guarantor Requirements and Objectives, and
	+ and all credit requirements being met
* The acceptable guarantors according to the guarantee type
* Other applicable policy rules


Exceptions may be considered by Credit, subject to strong mitigating reasons being provided.


 


#### 2\.1\.1 Guarantor direct benefit


Requirements for establishing that the guarantor will receive a direct benefit will vary from one application to another. 
Westpac Group is required to demonstrate that the guarantor made a fully informed decision and will receive a measurable benefit that is comparable to the risk they are taking on. A financial benefit is the easiest to define and measure (e.g. the guarantor living in the property they are guaranteeing free of rent). 
Non\-financial benefit is more difficult to measure and is, therefore, unlikely to be approved where the relationship is something other than a parent guaranteeing a loan for their children or a Shared Equity Guarantee. 


 



#### [2\.1\.2 ‘Other’ Guarantee types](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_‘Other’_Guarantee_types>)


 Guarantee types other than those specified under  [‘](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>)  Policy rules per guarantee type
' a are generally not acceptable unless a Guarantor direct benefit can be established.  

  

Credit approval is required for any ‘other’ guarantee type, and the
 application must be referred to Credit for assessment before any provisional
 approval decision is advised to the borrower.  

  

 Regardless of the guarantee amount, the borrowers are required to contribute
 a minimum 5% of the value of a security collateral being purchased plus
 purchase costs. These funds:
* re to be visible in the applicants' assets with a comment in ApplyOnline detailing which assets are being used to meet this requirement
* **are not** required to
 comply with to comply with [Genuine Savings](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000717) policy.


  

 #### 2\.1\.3 Unacceptable Guarantors

### 2\.3 Guarantee amount\-NCC and BCoP


Under NCC a guarantee can secure an amount that does not exceed the sum of the borrower’s liabilities, plus reasonable expenses of enforcing the guarantee, or any lesser amount agreed between us and the guarantor. BCoP also requires a guarantee to limit the guarantor’s liability.

#### 2\.4\.1 Family\-Security Guarantee


The amount of available equity in security collateral offered as the ‘Family –Security Guarantee’ must be determined, to ensure there is sufficient equity to provide the guarantee.  

The LVR calculation allows us to determine whether the loan requires mortgage insurance.  

  

The table below details how to calculate available equity, guarantee amount and LVR for a loan involving a ‘Family\-Security Guarantee’.


| Feature | Calculation |
| --- | --- |
| Available Equity in the Family\-Security Guarantee Collateral | **Determine:** A. the  guarantee security collateral value **B.** the maximum non LMI  LVR as per [Loan to Value (LVR)](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000684)  policy **C1.**  any existing  commitments (such as mortgages, pledges,  debts, guarantees, pledges, business overdrafts or other  liabilities) which have a right against the guarantee  security collateral    **Available Equity \=**(**A ‘**Guarantor’s security collateral  value’ *multiplied by* **B** ‘Non LMI LVR%’)  *minus* **C1**‘Existing commitments’ |

### 


#### 2\.4\.2 Shared Equity Guarantee


 The amount of available equity in security collateral offered as
 the Shared Equity must be determined, to ensure there is sufficient
 equity to provide the Shared Equity guarantee.  

  

**The table below illustrates the calculation of LVR, available equity and guarantee amount for a loan involving a ‘Shared Equity Guarantee’** 


| Feature | Calculation |
| --- | --- |
| Available Equity in the Shared Equity Guarantee Collateral | **Determine:**  **A.** the guarantee security collateral  value **B.**  the maximum non LMI LVR as per  [Loan to Value (LVR)](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000684)  policy **C  1  .**  any existing   commitments (such as mortgages, pledges, debts, guarantees, pledges,  business overdrafts or other liabilities) which have a right against  the guarantee security collateral **D.** The ownership percentage of the borrower and the  guarantor/s    **Available Equity \=**  ( **A ‘** Guarantor’s security collateral value’  *multiplied by* **B**  ‘Non LMI LVR%’) *minus*  **C  1**  ‘Existing commitments’ |

### [2\.5 Providing advice to borrowers and guarantors](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Providing_advice_to_borrowers_and_guar>)


The guarantor must be interviewed separately in the absence of the
 borrower.  

 When the proposed loan is either wholly or in part secured by a guarantee,
 the ‘Advice requirements’ in the table below apply. 


| Applicant type | Advice requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Borrower | The prospective borrowers must be made aware of the following requirements at the time of the interview: * Loans that involve individuals providing a guarantee type of ‘Family\-Security Guarantee’, 'Shared Equity Guarantee', ‘Spousal\-Security Guarantee’ or ‘Spousal\-Income \+ Security Guarantee’ are conditional on the guarantors obtaining independent legal advice and the Bank requires evidence that legal advice has been obtained. * Independent legal advice is recommended but not mandatory for individuals providing a guarantee type of ‘Spousal\-Income Guarantee’ * The solicitor's cost is the responsibility of the guarantor (or borrower).  Do not provide any advice in respect to the nature and effect of the guarantee. Note: Do not entrust the customer / borrower to act as Westpac's 'agent' to procure the guarantor's signature. Hand a copy of the Guarantor's Consent to Variation, Replacement or Alteration (LD164\) to each guarantor. Alternatively, the consent form can be posted to the individual guarantor. |
| Guarantor | The guarantor/s must be interviewed separately by the broker without the borrower present. At the interview, all prospective guarantors must be made aware of that: * Independent legal advice and evidence of this advice is mandatory for guarantee types of 'Family\-Security Guarantee’, 'Shared Equity Guarantee', ‘Spousal\-Security Guarantee’ or ‘Spousal\-Income \+ Security Guarantee’ * Independent legal advice is recommended but not mandatory for individuals providing a guarantee type of ‘Spousal\-Income Guarantee’ * There are financial risks involved in providing a guarantee, i.e. when the borrower is unable to the meet their financial obligations under the loan, the guarantor may need to pay for the debt commitments on behalf of the borrower. * The guarantor may request information about the proposed loan to be guaranteed. |


### [2\.6 Independent legal advice](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Independent_legal_advice>)


 ‘[Policy rules per acceptable guarantee type](#R_Policy_rules_per_guarantee_type)’ details when independent legal advice is required
 according to the guarantee type   

  

 If legal advice is required, the guarantor needs to obtain this from a
 solicitor independent of the bank and the borrower to understand their obligations
 and liability under the guarantee.  

The completed Guarantor’s Solicitor’s Certificate is to be
 provided to the Bank prior to settlement (i.e. release of loan
 funds) to evidence that independent legal advice has been
 received.  

 Waiving of independent legal advice where it
 is **required** under policy may only be approved
 by Credit on exception basis.  

 
#### [2\.6\.1 Determining written legal advice evidence requirements](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#r_Determining_written_legal_advice_evide>)


The written legal advice evidence requirements vary based on the guarantor’s location: 


| State | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Australian Capital Territory  Victoria  Northern Territory  Western Australia  South Australia  Queensland  Tasmania | A solicitor’s or barrister’s certificate  Independent legal advice is difficult to get in South  Australia, Western Australian and Tasmania. However, the  inability to obtain this advice is **not** grounds to warrant a  waiver |
| New South Wales | Statutory declaration made by the guarantor and witnessed by: * The solicitor who gave the legal advice * A justice of the peace, who is a member of the Australian Institute of Conveyancers |
| Note: The solicitor's certificate makes provision for more than one guarantor. Nevertheless, as a matter of policy, the documentation pack will include a separate form of certificate for each guarantor (certificates that have been amended to include more than one guarantor will be accepted). It is not for the Bank to be instructing solicitors as to who might be present at the time the advice is given. | |


#### [2\.6\.2 Independence of the solicitor](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#r_Independence_of_the_solicitor>)


The guarantor's solicitor must be independent of the Bank and the borrower, this includes: 
* The solicitor is not to be a solicitor for the Bank or for the borrower in the particular transaction
* The solicitor is not being a solicitor for any other interested party who might have previously given security. An example of an interested party is a guarantor who, having previously provided security, stands to benefit by way of reduced liability, from any additional security given by other guarantors.
* The solicitor is not to be a partner of any solicitor who acts for the borrower or other interested party.


**Exemption of independence rule**  

The solicitor can amend the certificate to signify that they also act
 for the borrower. Westpac Group, as a matter of policy exception, will
 generally accept the solicitor's certificate in such cases.  

 Exemption will **not** apply, for example,
 if: 
* A guarantor is open to influence by the others,
 **or**
* One guarantor is a spouse of the director who 'runs' the business, and is only involved in a formal manner or in some minor capacity


  

 #### [2\.6\.3 Legal advice dispensation](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Legal_advice_dispensation>)


Request for legal dispensation will be considered by Credit on an
 exception basis.  

   
#### [2\.6\.3\.1 Determining undue influence on the guarantor](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Determining_undue_influence_on_the_gua>)


If the Bank knows, or suspects, the guarantee relationship is one of dependency, reliance, or dominance, you must insist on independent legal advice and a solicitor’s certificate. Otherwise, the courts might presume that there was undue influence and set aside the guarantee.  

  

To help to determine whether there is undue influence, consider the following questions: 
1. Might anyone, in addition to the borrower, benefit from the guarantee being given?


This could include: 
* Other individuals who have already given, or are about to give, guarantees (e.g. husband and wife)
* If the borrower is a trust, a beneficiary of the trust, or
* Anybody else who has a significant direct or indirect interest in the borrower (e.g. shareholder)


1. What is the nature of the relationship between the guarantor and any other benefited person?


With some relationships there is a presumption of undue influence no matter (e.g. solicitor and client; parent and dependent child; trustee and beneficiary; priest and parishioner; doctor and patient). With others it depends on individual circumstances.  

  

Where a spouse is providing a guarantee, it is strongly recommended to insist on a solicitor's certificate except where it is clear that the spouse is: 
* Financially sophisticated
* Aware of the borrower's position
* Obtaining some benefit from the transaction.


#### Examples




| **Example Scenario** | Description |
| --- | --- |
| A Spouse guaranteeing their partner’s debt | In the normal case of a spouse guaranteeing their  partner's debts, the legal position is **not** clear.  It is safer where a spouse is providing a guarantee to  strongly recommend on a solicitor's certificate except where  it is clear that the spouse is: * Financially sophisticated * Aware of the borrower's position * Obtaining some benefit from the transaction. |
| Family\-Security Guarantees | Aged parents providing a guarantee to their children. |


   

   
### [2\.7 Financial Support Acknowledgement and Undertaking](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Financial_Support_Acknowledgement_and_>)


The ‘Financial Support Acknowledgement and Undertaking’ must be signed by the guarantor for the below guarantee types:
* Spousal\-Income Guarantee
* Spousal\-Income \+ Security Guarantee


## 


### [2\.8 Accepting a guarantee\- three (3\) day requirement](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#P_Accepting_a_guarantee-_three_day_requi>)


Once the guarantor has been provided with: 
* The terms and conditions of the guarantee
* Any notice of demand the Bank has made on the borrower in the past two years
* A copy of the borrower’s loan contract
* A copy of the borrower’s credit report
* A copy of the borrower’s financial accounts or statements held in the last two years for the guaranteed loan.
* A copy of any other information the guarantor reasonably requests about the guaranteed loan


Then the guarantor has a minimum of three days to consider the guarantee they are about to provide. We must not accept the signed and returned guarantee document until after the third day.  

  

The only exceptions we will consider and allow the guarantee to be accepted prior to three days are as follows: 
* If the guarantor has obtained independent legal advice and provided evidence
* If the guarantor is acting as trustee for a trust on the loan application.


Note: accepting the guarantee document back from the guarantor is different to requiring independent legal advice. All requirements of this policy must be met.  

  

Refer to the [Banking Code of Practice (BCOP)](https://www.ausbanking.org.au/policy/banking-code/) on signing and when to
 accept a guarantee.

 ## [1\. About this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_About_this_policy>)


### [1\.1 Why this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Why_this_policy>)


The purpose of this policy is to provide an overview of: 
* Costs which can be included in the loan amount
* Consumer mortgage application forms and declarations
* Power of Attorney rules
* Business lending customer rules
* Rules relating to:
	+ validating information provided by the customer
	+ the currency of completed verification activities
	+ the age of verification documents
	+ expiry dates associated with the consumer mortgage application


If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to *[Lenders Mortgage Insurance](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000725)* where required. 
## [2\. Rules you must apply](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Rules_you_must_apply>)


Note: Mortgage brokers are unable to submit their own applications i.e., where the finance broker submitting the application is also one of the applicants. Brokers are still able to submit loans for their family (as long as they are not an applicant) and they are also able to have another finance broker within their group submit a loan on their behalf.
### [2\.1 Loan Amount\-including costs](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Loan_Amount-including_costs>)


Costs associated with the purchase of the collateral (e.g. legal
 fees and stamp duty) can be included in the loan amount, providing the
 maximum lending value ratio is
 **not**
 exceeded.  

   
#### [2\.1\.1 Interest only in advance (IOA) loans](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Interest_only_in_advance_(IOA)_loans>)


The initial amount of prepaid interest can
 **not** be
 added to the loan amount. The borrower is to provide this amount from their
 own funds.  

   
### [2\.2 Customer Interview](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Customer_Interview>)


A formal face to face interview should be completed with the loan applicant(s) or guarantor(s) before acceptance of the loan offer agreement.
The interview process is to be carried out without the presence of a third party – must be between the Broker and applicant(s) or guarantor(s).

### 


### [2\.3 Customers Experiencing Vulnerability](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Customers_Experiencing_Vulnerability>)


 Refer to  [Eligibility](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000694) \>Customers Experiencing
 Vulnerability policy  

  
 ### 2\.4 In Principle Approval (IPA)


 In Principle Approval (IPA) is an application type which seeks 'Conditional
 Approval' only.   

Verification of supporting documentation and security
 collateral assessment is **not mandatory**.  

Consent forms and verification of identity (VOI) must be completed prior to ‘ Review and Submit’
 being undertaken for an IPA. Also see:

 * [**Acknowledgments,
 confirmations and consents (for 1st and
 3rd party channel) or Privacy Statement and
 other acknowledgements (for digital applications)
 (Consent Form),**](#R_Acknowledgments,_confirmations_and_con)
* [Playback form](#R_Playback_Form)
* [Responsible Lending Start Date](#2.6 Responsible Lending Start Date)


 When a borrower elects to proceed with the consumer mortgage application, the IPA
 needs to be converted to a ‘full consumer mortgage application’.  

**Note:** You can\-not convert a full application back to an IPA.

 
 
 ### [2\.4\.1 In Principle Approval (IPA) / Conditional Approval Validity period](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Conditional_Approval_Validity_period>)


The in principle approval (conditional approval) letter or notification has a validity period of 90 days from the most recent application Review and Submit date (both IPA and Full application stage). The expiry period ends either when the customer mortgage application is unconditionally approved, or the consumer mortgage application is edited and re\-assessed resulting in a new in principle approval (conditional approval). 


### 


### 2\.5 Full application


 A Full consumer mortgage application is an application type which seeks 'Formal
 Approval' (Unconditional Approval)   

An application may be created as a ‘full application’ or may be converted from an IPA to a ‘full application’.   

Verification of supporting documentation and security
 assessment **is mandatory** for Full
 Applications.  

Consent forms and verification of identity (VOI) must be completed prior to ‘ Review and Submit’
 being undertaken for a full application.  

 Also see:
 * [**Acknowledgments,
 confirmations and consents (for 1st and
 3rd party channel) or Privacy Statement and
 other acknowledgements (for digital applications)
 (Consent Form),**](#R_Acknowledgments,_confirmations_and_con)
* [Playback Form](#R_Playback_Form)
* [Responsible Lending Start Date](#2.6 Responsible Lending Start Date)


#### 


### 2\.6 Responsible Lending Start Date


 The Responsible Lending Start Date is used to determine if a verification document
 complies with the ‘maximum age’ policy.  

 Refer to:
 * [‘Loan Expiry Types’](#R_Loan_Expiry_Types_and_Rules) and rules for the ‘[Responsible Lending Start Date’](#2.6 Responsible Lending Start Date)
* Refer to ‘[Document Standards](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000692)’ for the maximum age of verification
 documents

### 2\.9 Pipeline Authority Policy




| Purpose | This policy identifies the standards for assessing an IPA or full application under a prior (old) credit policy |
| --- | --- |
| Exclusions | This policy does not need to be followed if the application meets the current (new) policy. |
| Applicable to | Consumer mortgage applications where a borrower is seeking any of:* new loan * loan increase |


  

 #### 2\.9\.1 Eligibility


An IPA or Full application can be assessed under prior (old) policy, if it complies with the table below.  

Applications that **do not** meet the rules may be referred to
 Credit for override consideration where justified. E.g. process errors.
 If LMI is applicable, LMI Underwriter approval (DUA4\) will be
 required.  

If ‘non\-standard’ pipeline condition/s apply to a specific policy change, they will be documented in the related change communication.  

  
 

| Pipeline Eligibility Rules | | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **S****cenario** | | Application stage | | **A****pplicable to** | | Can be assessed under old (prior) policy if: | | |
|  | 1 | | A‘Review and  Submit’ (RnS) decision **had not** previously  occurred | | Third Party (Broker)  applications **only** | | * The application  met the prior (old) credit policy, but now fails the  current (new) policy;  and * The Apply Online (AOL) submission date was no more than 90 days prior to the policy change date;  AND one of the below apply:* The system input change (in the Third Party originations system or OBP) was triggered by a standard validation activity, to align input with:  	+ supporting documents provided by the finance broker at the time the application is submitted; or 	+ the internally sourced credit bureau report; or 	+ an internal system extract 	 or enquiry (Westpac or St.George 	 Bank Group) refer [Document standards](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000692)  Warning: Refer to [Loan Expiry Types and Rules](#R_Loan_Expiry_Types_and_Rules) for information  regarding loan re\-assessment requirements (e.g.  Responsible Lending Expiry) which override this pipeline  policy. OR* No [Material changes](#Material Changes)   have occurred since the AOL submission  date |  |
|  | 2 | | A ‘Review and Submit’ (RnS) decision  **had** previously occurred | | First Party and Third Party (Broker) applications | | The application met the prior (old) credit policy, but now fails current (new)  policy,  and:* A ‘Review and Submit’ (RnS) **– ‘passed’** decision*(approval granted manually or automatically)*was no more  than 90 days prior to the policy change  date; and * No [Material changes](#Material Changes) have  occurred since the RnS **‘passed’** date |  |
|  | [Material Changes](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#Material Changes>) | | | | | | |  |
|  | For Mortgage insured and Non\-mortgage insured applications: | | | | | | Some examples: |  |
|  | * **Assets** are  decreased | | | | | | Title search indicates an asset is not owned by the borrower and is deleted |  |
|  | * **Borrower/s or guarantor/s** – are  deleted or added | | | | | | * Additional borrower is added to application * A borrower becomes a guarantor or guarantor becomes a borrower |  |
|  | * **Credit bureau**: A new decline or  refer decision is received related to credit  bureau default or  bankruptcy | | | | | | Initial application shows no defaults. At a decision run after the policy change, borrower one now has a Telstra default for $120 |  |
|  | * **Employment mode** is  changed | | | | | | Employment mode is changed from full time to casual (even if on the same income) |  |
|  | * **Expenses, outgoings or existing loan repayments** are  increased | | | | | | * Borrower 1 and 2 have increased rental outgo * Borrower 2 has an existing loan (not the loan being processed) and the repayments are increased for that loan |  |
|  | * **Income** is  reduced | | | | | | Allowable social security income removed as it does not meet social security income requirements due to the age of the dependants |  |
|  | * **Liabilities** areincreased  (internal or external) | | | | | | Applicant three has a new credit card added |  |
|  | * **Security collateral is** added  or removed  Applies to:* Full applications * IPAs where the  security **had been** previously  identified | | | | | | The initial application (Full or IPA) involved the purchase of security collateral ‘A’. After receiving an unsatisfactory building inspection report, the purchase contract for ‘A’ is cancelled. The borrower offers a new Security property ‘B’. |  |
|  | **Security collateral** is added or  removed Applies to:* IPA where the security **had not been** previously  identified  When the security collateral is identified and:* it is unacceptable; or * the IPA to Full application contains  another ‘[Material Change](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>)’ listed in  this table | | | | | | The initial application was an IPA for a loan of $400k and purchase of $500k but the actual security address had not been identified. The borrower has now found a property, and it is on the unacceptable Security Development Register list |  |
|  | For Non\-Mortgage insured applications: | | | | | | Some examples: |  |
|  | * **Loan amount** isincreased,  and: 	+ the increase **is** 	 greater than 10% of the original 	 loan amount, 	 or: 	+ the increase **is not** 	 greater than 10% of the original 	 loan amount **but** the increased 	 loan amount would have failed 	 serviceability on the prior (old) 	 policy | | | | | | The initial application was an In  Principle Approval (IPA) for a loan of $400k and  purchase of $500k. The borrower has now found a property  costing more at $550k and requires a loan for $441k  (10\.25% increase).  If the loan was increased to $440k this would be non\-  material as the increase is \=10% (not  greater) |  |
|  | **For** **mortgage insured applications:** | | | | | | Some examples: |  |
|  | * **Loan amount** is  increased | | | | | | Any loan amount increase |  |
|  | * **LVR** is increased due to a low  valuation and the  application: * previously required LMI; or * now requires LMI as a result of the low valuation | | | | | | Application is lodged for a refinance  of an existing debt. The borrower estimates that the  property is valued at $500k and based on the estimate  our LVR is 80%.  When the valuation is completed the customer estimate  was high and the actual value of the property came in at  $470k.  LVR has increased to 85% and now LMI is  required. |  |

 ### [2\.13 Business Purpose Declaration](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Business_Purpose_Declaration>)


If the loan purpose established is wholly or predominantly (i.e. more than or equal to 50%) for business purposes then it is not eligible for a consumer product and must the referred to Business banking. Refer to [Eligibility](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000694).  

It is the Broker or Assessor's responsibility to determine whether a loan agreement is to be regulated or not under the National Credit Code. This is determined from loan purpose (not the collateral/s offered to support the loan).  

As a guide the following questions may be used to assist Brokers or Assessors in determining whether the loan is regulated or not under NCC: 
1. Is this loan in a Company Name? (If **YES**, never
 regulate.)
2. Will another property be the principal place of residence?
3. Are the loan funds to be used for any business purposes and / or investment purposes other than investment in residential property?
4. Are the loan funds to be used wholly or predominantly for business purpose and /or investment purposes other than investing in residential property?


Where the answer to questions 1, 3\-4 inclusive is
 **YES**, the loan may be unregulated.

The assessor must advise  the broker to resubmit the application in AOL .      Broker must ensure that all the details provided within the  application are reconfirmed with borrower prior to  re\-submission     Upon re\-submitting the application, the RL expiry period will be  reset, and documents must be re\-verified.  Refer to Verification      Verification   Verification tasks must be completed and updated / new verification  documentation is required where:  * the relevant verification document has ‘expired’, i.e. it does not meet the ‘maximum age’ policy against the new Responsible Lending Start Date * Information requiring verification has changed (e.g. income has changed) |
| Loan Drawdown | Loan Offer generated date | **For single draw loans:** Loan not drawn within 180 days of the Start  Date.    **For Progress Draw loans:** Initial draw down has not occurred within 12 months of  the Start Date. |

If the loan offer is returned after 14 days but within any other expiry periods, it can be accepted without any further action. | If the RL expiry date is sooner than the loan offer 14 day expiry period, the loan offer will expire in line with the RL expiry date. The consumer mortgage application must be re\-submitted and re\-assessed with a new loan offer generated. |


      

  
## 3\. Comprehensive Credit Report (CCR) Mismatch


 Where a mismatch is identified during manual review of the report, further
 investigation and action is required. For specific scenarios, refer to the table
 below:  

  
 

| Scenario | | Action | Additional requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **The applicant advises the facility has been closed but the CCR still shows the account as open.** | Evidence that the account has been closed must be obtained prior to  formal approval. Refer to [Serviceability assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710) \> Rules \>Amended current  commitment  **Note:** If unable to obtain evidence of closure,  then the commitment is to be included in the serviceability  assessment | Enter application comments detailing the outcome of all related customer discussions |
| 2 | **The applicant advises the facility has been paid back, but the CCR shows the account is still open as they have not formally closed the facility** | Further enquires are to be made with the applicant:   If the applicant wants to retain the facility, then the commitment  is to be included in the serviceability assessment. Verify the  details of the commitment as per [Commitments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690)  \>  Verifying customer commitments     If the applicant does not want to retain the facility, they will  need to provide evidence the facility has been closed as per  Scenario 1 | Enter application comments detailing the outcome of all related  customer discussions |

[1\.1 Why this policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Why_this_policy>)


| Purpose | Living expenses materially affect the ability of a residential mortgage borrower to meet repayments due on a loan and are a key component of a serviceability assessment.  The declared living expenses are used by the Bank as part of the unsuitability assessment as required under our Responsible Lending obligations.  This policy identifies the standards for:* enquiring about and capturing living  expense information for each **borrower and income guarantor** that is contractually  bound to repay the loan |
| --- | --- |
| Applicable to | * Consumer mortgage applications where a borrower is seeking any of:  	+ new loan 	+ loan increase 	+ servicing / variation activity requiring a serviceability assessment |
| Policy exclusion | This policy does not apply to a Bridging ICAP loan with no end debt |
| Reading this policy | Unless specifically stipulated otherwise, the content applies to both non\-mortgage insured (non\-MI) and mortgage insured (MI) consumer mortgage loan applications |
| Associated policies | You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to:* Commitments * Guarantees * Serviceability assessment * Validation of information provided by the customer * If the application requires mortgage insurance, where required refer to: 	+ Lenders Mortgage Insurance |

## [2\. Rules you must apply](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Rules_you_must_apply>)

### [2\.1 Capturing customer declared living expenses](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Capturing_cust_decl_living_expenses_ap>)


It is critical that an appropriate level of enquiry is made, to ensure that an accurate view of the declared household living expenses are captured.  

Refer to [Glossary](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000723) for
 definition of a ‘household’  

Living expenses must be captured and entered according to the set expense category. It is not acceptable to 'bundle' across expense categories.  

**Borrowers and income guarantors** are required to declare all
 ongoing household living expenses that:
* are in place as at time of the application, and
* will be in place after settlement of their loan




Brokers
 are to assist by providing a description of each expense category to ensure the declared responses clearly align to our requirements. Refer
 to Expense category tables in [Living Expenses compared to HEM](#R_Living_expenses_compared_to_HEM) and
 [Living Expenses not compared to HEM](#R_Living_expenses_not_compared_to_HEM)



  

 Brokers cannot suggest a value on the applicant's behalf, except when rental income
 used in the serviceability assessment is rental income (in AUD) from a property
 rented on a short term basis.
 * Refer to:
	+ [Rental expenses from a property rented on a short term basis](#2.16 Rental expenses from a property rented on a short term basis) , and
	+ [Verifying Income](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000721) \> Supplementary income \> Rental income (in AUD)
	 Rent received on a short term basis


### [2\.2 Reducing living expenses](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Reducing_living_expenses>)


 We acknowledge that a customer may change their spending behaviour when they have a
 new mortgage repayment obligation or following a change in circumstances (e.g.
 children moving out of parent's house).  

  

 We accept that such a change often involves a reduction in discretionary
 (non\-essential) expenses such as recreation, entertainment, clothing, personal care
 and groceries. It is less likely that a customer can easily reduce expenses that are
 more stable by nature such as insurances, property\-related costs, utilities,
 education and telephone. Refer to Expense category tables in [Living Expenses compared to HEM](#R_Living_expenses_compared_to_HEM) and [Living Expenses not compared to HEM](#R_Living_expenses_not_compared_to_HEM) to identify
 discretionary v’s non\-discretionary expense types.  

  

 Where the customer has told us that they are prepared to reasonably change their
 lifestyle to reduce living expenses, we may adjust customer declared expense amounts
 in the loan assessment system provided:
 * Broker has had a robust discussion with customer around their living
 expenses patterns; **and**
* The reduction appears reasonable; **and**
* Overall comments are recorded in ApplyOnline detailing:
	+ the customer discussion
	+ what expenses have been adjusted and by how much
	+ the reasons why the reductions were deemed acceptable by the Broker.


 The customer declared amount cannot be accepted for any outgoing child support,
 alimony, rent / board (post settlement). The amount of the payment must be
 verified, for further information refer to [Commitments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690)
*policy*  

  
 ### [2\.3 Conflicting information](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Conflicting_information>)


 After the declared living expenses have been captured, we may need to make further
 enquiries if

 * during the assessment of the application we identify information which
 conflicts with the declared expenses as per [Loan Application and Approval](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698) \>
 Validation of information provided by the customer policy
* OBP referral rule 'Customer Declared
 Expenses being \< 70% of HEM’ has been triggered.


   

 ### [2\.4 Living expenses compared to HEM](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Living_expenses_compared_to_HEM>)


 These living living expense:

 * categories will be compared to the HEM value;
 **and**
	+ the higher of the declared expenses or HEM will be used in the serviceability calculation
* are used to calculate the expense to net \[discounted] HEM ratio at application level. This is used to assist in:
* understanding the  level of expenses;
 **and**
* identifying where they are materially different
 (higher or lower) to the Household Expenditure Measure . Refer
 [*Serviceability assessment*](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710) for HEM
 values.


Applications where the declared living expenses are assessed as materially low in relation to their income and insufficient to maintain a reasonable standard of living will require further detailed commentary and mitigation before approval can be considered.

 detailed in the table:

 ### [2\.6 Factors affecting HEM / living expenses](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Factors_affecting_HEM_living_expenses>)


 Other factors which may impact living expenses are:

 * post settlement postcode
	+ Where an In Principle Approval application is submitted, the post settlement postcode is to be captured as accurately as possible
	+ The application must reflect the actual post settlement postcode for formal approval.
* number of dependants \- refer to *[Definition of a Dependant](#R_Definition_of_a_Dependant)*


It is a mandatory to capture these details within the loan assessment system.   

   
 ### [2\.7 Apportioning declared living expenses in loan application](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Apportioning_declared_living_expenses_>)


 The table below details whether household living expenses can be apportioned,
 according to how the spouse is associated with the loan
 application    

  
 

| Application Type | Apportioning Rules | Additional information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spouse is also a borrower | Apportioning the household living expenses against these parties is not restricted | Restriction applies to apportioning 'Investment Property Costs (Including Insurance)'.

#### 


### [2\.14 Definition of a Dependant](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Definition_of_a_Dependant>)


A dependant is defined as: 
* a child under the age of 18 years; or
* a child aged 18 years or older who lives with the applicant, receives no income from government benefits, employment or other income sources, and is totally financially reliant on the applicant (e.g. A full time unemployed student, or a child with a disability living at home permanently)


where the applicant has legal responsibility for the care and welfare of
 the child, on either a full or part time basis. **Note:**
 The child under the age of 18 years may or may not reside with the
 applicant.  

  

 Unborn children are not considered dependants.
  Variance to this rule where  [Serviceability Assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710)  \> Parental leave – use of ‘return
 to work’ income’ policy is applied.    

  

Any additional expenses for children over the age of 18 living at home
 need to be captured in the living expenses discussion with the
 customer.  

  

 If applicants are expecting to add to their family, this should be
 identified during completion of Responsible Lending requirements by way of
 question: Do you expect any significant changes to your financial situation
 over the next 3 years that would adversely impact your ability to meet your
 repayments?  Refer to *[Serviceability Assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710)*   

  

Where the child does not reside with the applicant it is acceptable to
 use an outgoing child support payment in place of including the child as a
 dependant for serviceability purposes. If no child support is paid or child
 support is paid and the child resides with the applicant the child must be
 included as a dependant for serviceability purposes. Any shared custody
 arrangements should be clearly explained in the application  

  

 The amount of any outgoing child support payment must be verified for
 further information refer to [Commitments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690)
policy   

  
 ### 2\.15 Rental expenses from a property rented on a short term basis


 When rental income used in the serviceability assessment is rental income (in
 AUD) From a property rented on a short term basis and this property was rented
 for the full 52 weeks of the year. The expenses declared on the rental schedule
 other that interest, depreciation and once off capital expenses must be used.
 Refer to  [Verifying Income](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000721) \> Supplementary income \> Rental
 income (in AUD) Rent received on a short term
 basis  

  

Where the short\-term rental property has not been rented for the full 52 weeks of the year, expenses incurred when the property is not rented are to be entered into customer expenses either as an owner occupied primary or owner\-occupied secondary expenses. The lender should discuss with the customer to determine whether the property is owner occupied primary or owner occupied secondary and document accordingly.   

  

If the property is owner\-occupied and has a separate area of occupancy (granny flat) being used for short term rent, the owner\-occupied portion of expenses is to be separated from the investment portion. Like above, the investment portion can be determined from the rental schedule in the tax return and the owner\-occupied portion can be determined through a customer conversation.

 ### [2\.8 Approval from foreign investment review board (FIRB)](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R__Approval_from_foreign_investment_revi>)


Holders of Australian temporary residency visas require approval from the Federal Government Treasury – Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). It is the responsibility of the purchaser to ensure approval is held.   

  

Where the borrower is, or will be on the title, a copy of the FIRB approval must be held prior to issuing a formal approval.  The loan application must be validated against the FIRB approval to ensure the application complies with the conditions under which the FIRB approval was issued.

 the FIRB requirement is where the applicant is purchasing or owns a property as
 Joint Tenants\* (50/50\), with an Australian or New Zealand citizen, or a
 Permanent Resident, who is their spouse.   

   

**\***  The exception does not apply where the property ownership is Tenants
 in Common (e.g. 80/20\).   

  

Where the applicant lives and works overseas and FIRB indicates approval is
 for their principal place of residence  \#  , then the property:
 
1. Must be their principal place of residence while in Australia.
2. Cannot be used for investment (rental) or holiday purposes and rental income against this property is not acceptable.


Notes:
* In some cases FIRB approval is granted to a specific development. The developer may receive a certificate identifying that further foreign investment approval is not required when sales are made to foreign persons.
* A copy of the FIRB approval issued to the developer is to be retained on file. The offered security property (for purchase or refinance) should match the property identified in the FIRB approval.

Authorities to Return and Return Endorsements can no longer be granted but may still be valid.

 ### [1\.1 Why this policy?](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#A_Why_this_policy?>)


The Bank requires acceptable building insurance cover on a replacement and reinstatement basis over the real estate property used as security collateral for the loan.   

Insurance cover will protect the value of the secured asset in the event the owner and Bank is required to rely upon it.   

Adequate insurance cover is to be maintained for the duration of the
 loan.

* Take out any other insurances required by policy, such as builder’s risk insurance
* Negotiate with the insurer on the minimum cover amount with a recommendation of full replacement cost
* Have a current or renew building insurance policy during the loan contract term. Failure to do so is a breach under the terms of the contract and mortgage by borrower/ mortgagor.


The Bank cannot suggest a minimum amount the property must be insured
 for.

## 2\. Rules you must apply


  

 ### 2\.1 Identifying and Assessing self\-employed applications


 Where the applicant earns PAYG income (or other supplementary income) but also has
 a   directorship  1   or ABN for a business, and the applicant is not
 being assessed under Fast Track, Lenders / Assessors are required
 to identify how the applicant is related to the business and if the applicant
 is a director and / or shareholder.  Where the applicant is a director and / or
 shareholder, further investigation of the business is to be completed (even where
 income from the business is not being used for serviceability assessment) to
 establish the below:

 * When the applicant became a director;
* The percentage of shareholding;
* If the business is trading / non\-trading; and
* If the business is profitable or able to able to service it's own commitments


 1   Where the applicant is either an Independent director or an
 Executive director they are not considered to be the business owner and do not need
 to be assessed as a self\-employed applicant.

 * **Independent director**: A director that does not have a
 vested interest i.e. they are not a shareholder and the directorship
 is not held in a business that is owned (shareholding \> 0%) or
 controlled (directorship) by a spouse or family member (e.g. child
 or parent) or a subsidiary entity of the director or director's
 spouse / family member.
* **Executive director**: A director that
 does have a vested interest (a minor % shareholding of
 \<\=5%) however limited to also being an independent
 PAYG employee.  E.g. the CEO of Westpac is a
 director but also an independent PAYG employee (PAYG
 employee of a business that is not their own
 business).


 For further information about how to investigate directorships refer to  [Completing ABN, business name or company searches](#R_completing_ABN_business_name_or_compan).  

  

Assessing self\-employed applicants is different from assessing PAYG applicants for a number of key reasons as follows: 
* Salary or drawings taken from a business by a self\-employed applicant may not reflect the underlying sustainable earnings capability of the business. The owner may be draining the business of its reserves by paying him/herself an inflated salary, over and above what the business can afford.
* The earnings of a self\-employed applicant may vary significantly from year to year depending on business cycles and how well the business is performing. Significant variations may affect the applicant's ability to repay the loan and therefore the variability of income is to be included as part of the assessment process.
* Private and business expenses can become intermingled.
* Self\-employed people have a greater opportunity to adjust their income to indicate servicing capacity that may not exist.
* Self\-employed people may have a number of sources of income that have to be taken into account when assessing their capacity to service.


A separate process is necessary for self\-employed applications to: 
* Determine real income available for loan servicing.
* Ensure an appropriate legal structure for the loan.
* Ensure appropriate security arrangements for the loan.


Any non self\-employed income is to be verified as per policy contained
 in [Verifying Income](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000721).

This figure is prior to addbacks, subtractions, or  adjustments as required in terms of self\-employed  policy.  **Note:** if the  partnership includes foreign income and an exception has been  requested to consider this income, then use the “Total of items  20 \- 23” figure (typically item 24 in the tax return). This  figure is the total income figure  **after** the “Net  Australian income \- other than capital gains” figure.     Financials (profit loss and balance sheets), when required  to be provided, are to be used as supporting information to  help understand the business, including the income type,  addbacks, subtractions, liabilities, profitability, and the  flow of income between the business, individuals, and other  entities. |
| Use of undistributed company profits towards individual serviceability calculations | Where the borrower(s) is both a current company director  **and** a shareholder,  **and** owns a controlling  interest in a company\* (i.e. ≥ 50% shareholding) currently  and for the two financial years being assessed (or one year where  acceptable to use one year’s financials, e.g. Medico)  **and** there is a shortfall in  serviceability from the borrowers individual incomes, undistributed  company earnings may be added to the borrowers' incomes,  **only proportionate to the level of ownership / shareholding held**.   To establish that the borrower(s) has met the eligibility  criteria for use of undistributed company profits, the  Broker / Assessor must complete a company search and review  the search to confirm the borrower(s): * Is a current director **and** * Currently holds \>\=50% shareholding in the company  **and** * Was a director and \>\=50% shareholder in the company for the two financial years being assessed (including where backdated), or one year where acceptable to use one year’s financials (e.g. Medico)  Refer to *[completing ABN, business name or company searches](#R_completing_ABN_business_name_or_compan).*   The Broker is required to record comments in the assessment  system confirming the above and upload to ApplyOnline the  company search and any relevant document search relating to  a change(s) to directorship and / or shareholding.   The borrower(s) will be ineligible to use undistributed  company profit where they are not currently a director and  \>\=50% shareholder, have been added as a director and /or  shareholder\# or their shareholding  has increased to ≥50% (including where backdated), during  the two financial years used in the serviceability  assessment (or one year where acceptable to use one year’s  financials, e.g. Medico).   Where it is evident over the two financial years (or one  year where acceptable to use one year’s financials, e.g.  Medico) used in the serviceability assessment or in the  period preceding the loan application submission, that a  borrower’s shareholding in a company: * Meets the minimum 50% ownership requirement, but has increased (e.g. FY19 50% shareholding and FY20 70% shareholding), then the lower historical shareholding ownership percentage (e.g. 50%) of the banks calculated adjusted net profit after tax and repayments may be used in serviceability assessment * Has decreased from ≥ 50% to \< 50%, then unable to use  company profit in the serviceability assessment. Where the  company is making a loss, the loss however must still be  included in the serviceability assessment, refer to *[Self\-employed activity has made a loss or if it has been identified it cannot service its commitments on its own](#R__SE_activity_has_made_a_loss_or_cannot)*.**  \#Where there is  more than one borrower and the borrowers combined have \>\=  50% shareholding, they are eligible to use undistributed  company profit to their combined ownership % amount.   This is not a policy exception.    **Note:** * For all loan applications using undistributed company profits in serviceability, the impacts to the company must be discussed with the borrower(s) and documented in the loan assessment notes. The customer needs to confirm that the company has not used the profits for any other purpose and the funds are available to assist with the borrower’s personal commitments. * The self\-employed entity is to have been established and  trading for a minimum of two full financial  years1. ABN registration2 must be  confirmed by the Broker / Assessor via an ABN search and the  search retained in the loan file.

2 An ABN is compulsory under the Act in order for
 the business to register for compulsory GST where a 'for profit' enterprise
 has a GST turnover (i.e. business turnover) of ≥ $75,000\.  

   
#### 2\.1\.2 Self\-employed activity has made a loss or if it has been identified it cannot service its commitments on its own


* The loss must be reflected in the serviceability assessment. Applicants will need to explain how any ongoing business commitments will be met. It is vital to understand if the individuals are going to be negatively impacted by the business's financial position. Loan application notes must capture outcomes of the Broker’s discussion with the applicant.
* If the business is trading at a loss **or**
 if it has been identified it cannot service its commitments on its own, you
 are unable to rely on ‘latest year’ financial information or 'Accountants
 letter/email advice’.
* Where a borrower’s shareholding in a company has reduced (e.g. 80% to 20%) across the two financial years used in the serviceability assessment or in the period preceding loan application submission and the company is trading at a loss, then the loss must be apportioned to the borrower based on the borrower’s highest percentage ownership (e.g. 80%), over the period being assessed.

 ### 2\.3 Serviceability calculations and approval conditions \- fully verified self\-employed assessment


Serviceability will initially be tested based on the standard assessment
 2 year average method. (exceptions may apply \- refer to '*[Exceptions to providing 2 years tax returns / financials](#R_Exceptions_to_providing_2_years_tax_re)'* )  

 Minimum DSC requirements will vary depending on the security or borrower
 type. For additional information refer to *[Serviceability Assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710) *\> Rules \> Debt Service Coverage Ratio ( DSC )**  

The income used for serviceability assessment is outlined in the table
 below:  

   


| Income assessment method | Scenario | Income used for serviceability assessment | **Approval conditions** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Fully verified self\-employed – 2 year average](#R_Fully_verified_SE_standard_assessment_)  **Or**  Fully verified self\-employed – Latest year income | Most recent years income is lower than the prior years income. | The most recent year’s income must be used for serviceability. |  |
| Fully verified self\-employed – 2 year average | When the most recent year’s income is higher than the prior year. | The average of the most recent year and the prior year’s income must be used for serviceability. | For policy rules refer to [Fully verified self\-employed assessment \> income assessment method \>](#R_Fully_verified_SE_standard_assessment_)   [Fully verified – 2 year average](#R_Fully_verified_SE_standard_assessment_) |
| Fully verified self\-employed – Latest year income | When the latest year’s income is higher than the previous year. | The latest years income may be used for serviceability when the approval conditions and the Fully verified self\-employed – Latest year income policy has been met. | **Non\-mortgage insured only (** Mortgage  insured applications are not eligible for assessment using latest  year income)  Lender /assessors can approve where:  * the 2 year average income is \<\=  130% of the prior year's figure;  **and** * the appropriate self\-employed OVA is held (providing the remainder of the application is within their authority).   Where the 2 years average income is \> 130% of the prior year’s income then following options are available: 1. Assess serviceability using the Fully  verified self\-employed assessment \> income  assessment method \> Fully verified – 2 year  average ; **or** 2. Refer the loan  application to Credit with  supporting rational discussing the  change in business profitability and  how this is considered sustainable.   [Refer to Guide to understanding changes to business profitability and recording supporting rational](#G_Guide_to_understanding_changes_to_busi) e for  Fully verified \- Latest year  assessment. * Credit will review and may either: 	+ support and approve within policy, 	+ recommend 	 assessment based on a 2 year 	 average; **or** 	+ request further supporting commentary / documentation if appropriate. |


  

 #### 2\.3\.1 Allowable addbacks


Where Addbacks are being used for income assessment the Broker / Assessor must ensure their loan assessment notes identify the addbacks being used and explain why it should be considered.   

**Note:** On loans where LMI is required and addbackss other than Depreciation, Interest, Leasing and Hire purchase are required to meet servicing, such proposals must be referred to the Mortgage Insurer.   

  
 #### 2\.3\.2 Depreciation


#### Definition


Depreciation is an accounting method for allocating the cost of a tangible or physical asset over its useful life or life expectancy. Depreciation represents how much of an asset's value has been used up. Depreciation 'expenses' are generally considered not direct costs to the business, hence cash\-flow should be available to meet loan repayments.   

  

**Note**: Depreciation is not an acceptable addback for a Trust entity, given the manner in which a trust utilises depreciation is quite unique and not comparable to other entity types. As a result of the method used by a trust to disburse profits to its beneficiaries, we cannot accurately determine if a beneficiary received a monetary benefit from the depreciation. 

 

   

**When can depreciation be used as an addback for serviceability assessment** 


| **What % can I use** | When | **What do I need to do** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100% | * The business type must be a sole trader, partnership or  company; **and** * The depreciated assets are under  finance **and** a corresponding liability is evident on the balance sheet.   We permit the addback in this instance because if at a future point in time the asset requires renewal, the applicant may also renew the debt and in our serviceability assessment we have included the existing commitment | **Non\-mortgage insured applications**  Where ApplyOnline or the Serviceability Calculator is the assessment tool: * ensure a commitment has been loaded (refer to *[Commitments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690)*policy for further details about verification  requirements)  Mortgage insured applications* Same as non\-mortgage insured applications  **plus**, application must be referred to  the Credit for consideration. * Credit may choose to allow the use of depreciation in whole or part for serviceability assessment |
| Depreciation addback percentage which can be used may vary between 0% \- 100% * Depreciation addback must be adjusted in line with personal use percentage | * The business type must be a sole trader, partnership or  company; **and** * The depreciation is in respect of an income  producing asset (that is  **not**  under finance) and that asset is required to be maintained / updated to ensure continuance of the income.     Examples of this would include: * Taxi operators applying depreciation on their cab. * Truck operators depreciating their truck/s. * Excavation/Earthmoving operators applying depreciation on machinery. * Restaurant equipment / furnishings or fit out.  In these types of scenarios, the depreciation item claimed should not be added back, as the equipment itself will require maintenance and / or replacement at some point, hence funds will need to be apportioned / set aside to be able to do this. | **Non\-mortgage insured applications**  You must: * contact the applicant and obtain additional information to  understand if the assets being depreciated: 	+ are being used for personal purposes and if so, the 	 percentage used for personal and business use 	 (depreciation addback percentage cannot exceed the 	 business use percentage) **and** 	+ the lifespan of these assets and whether 	 these are integral to the daily operation of the 	 business **and** * Record the outcome of the discussions in loan assessment  notes **and** * Upload to ApplyOnline any supporting documentation such as a depreciation schedule  Mortgage insured applications* Same as non\-mortgage insured applications **plus,** application must be referred to the Credit for  consideration. * Credit may choose to allow the use of depreciation in whole or part for serviceability assessment |


  

 #### 2\.3\.3 Amortisation


Amortisation is the deduction of capital expenses over a specific period of time. Similar to depreciation, it is a method of measuring the consumption of the value of goodwill over a period of time. Amortisation can be included as an allowable addbacks.  

  

**Note**: Amortisation is not an acceptable addback for a Trust entity given the manner in which a trust utilises amortisation is quite unique and not comparable to other entity types. As a result of the method used by a trust to disburse profits to its beneficiaries, we cannot accurately determine if a beneficiary received a monetary benefit from the Amortisation.   

  

 
#### 2\.3\.4 Interest (bank borrowings) Leasing or Hire Purchase fixed commitments




| Addback type | May be added back where the below conditions are satisfied |
| --- | --- |
| Leasing or Hire purchase fixed commitments | * The full monthly repayment for the fixed commitment is included as part of the applicants outgoing costs; or * The liability has been repaid since lodgement of the financial statements; or * The fixed commitment is being refinanced as part of this loan application |
| Interest | * The full monthly repayment for the fixed commitment is included as part of the applicants outgoing costs; or * The liability has been repaid since lodgement of the financial statements; or * The fixed commitment is being refinanced as part of this loan application |


In ApplyOnline, load under appropriate add\-back heading e.g. interest or leasing (excludes scenarios where net rental calculation worksheet has been used).
#### 2\.3\.5 Superannuation (Sole Trader, Partnerships and Company Structures)


A superannuation guarantee cost is only compulsory to a Sole Trader, Partnership that has an external employee or under a company structure. 
* Though it is not compulsory for self\-employed applicants to contribute towards superannuation, in some instances, applicants do make large bulk payments to such funds. Owners of companies often make contributions on their own behalf in excess, of the statutory superannuation guarantee amount.
* The superannuation guarantee cost is assessed as a percentage of the salary and the director’s fees (in the case of a company) paid to the employees and company director(s). The amount of any contribution made in excess, of the statutory requirement, may be used as an addbacks. This will only be considered appropriate when the Profit and Loss statement clearly shows payments were made on behalf of the applicants and not the employees and it can be demonstrated that the excess contributions are not required to service any Self\-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) borrowings that the self\-employed applicant may have.


  

 

| Sole trader, Partnership |  |
| --- | --- |
| Net profit from the Business | $30,000 |
| Statutory superannuation guarantee amount | Nil |
| Superannuation paid | $ 5,000 |
| Excess Contribution | $ 5,000 |
| Company (in this example a director’s fee was not paid.) |  |
| PAYG Salary from the Company | $30,000 |
| Statutory superannuation guarantee cost at 9\.5%  Note  : the  statutory superannuation guarantee cost of 9\.5% is used  for illustration purposes only. Refer to the  [Australian Taxation Office](https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/key-superannuation-rates-and-thresholds/?anchor=Superguaranteepercentage#Superguaranteepercentage)  for current Super  Guarantee rates. | $ 2,850 |
| Superannuation paid | $ 5,000 |
| Excess Contribution | $ 2,150 |


  

 #### 2\.3\.6 Non\-recurring items


Self\-employed applicants may incur significant one\-off expenses or
 income items that are not part of normal business activities. Where one of
 these items are incurred, for the purposes of the Bank's income assessment,
 the non\-recurring expense should be added back to the net income
 prior to taxation being calculated and the non\-recurring income item,
 must be subtracted from the net income prior to taxation being
 calculated.  

    

 Example of one\-off income: 
* Capital gain following the sale of an asset.
* The profit received from the sale of an asset.
* Non\-recurring interest.
* Employee fringe benefit contribution.
* Any grant or boost payment.


Examples of one\-off expenses: 
* The loss realised following the disposal of an asset.
* Once off significant bad debt write\-off.


   

 Addbacks from Capital accounts are not acceptable for income assessment
 purposes as they reflect a reduction in the net worth of the entity.
 
#### 2\.3\.7 Working Capital


If the business is one that requires working capital, i.e.,
 manufacturing, trading, etc ensure sufficient working capital is
 available.   

 If undistributed profits are to be used in the serviceability assessment,
 consideration needs to be made whether the loss of funds will affect the
 business / company.  

  
### 2\.4 Fast track self\-employed assessment


Fast Track assessment is a simple Self\-Employed income assessment method relying on the applicants 2 year’s personal Australian Taxation Office (ATO) Notice of Assessments (NOA's). To assess income under the Self\-employed Fast Track income verification method: 
* The eligibility criteria must be met.
* Income from the self\-employed applicant is to be verified completely from the applicants personal ATO NOA's, i.e. no further self\-employed income documentation (within age of documentation requirements) is to be held or requested, where servicing is met using income from the ATO NOA’s.
* An ABN search must be performed on all associated self\-employed entities to
 confirm a minimum of two full financial years self\-employment. Refer to [completing ABN, business name or company searches](#R_completing_ABN_business_name_or_compan)


  

If the applicant is self\-employed and also has a second completely
 independent PAYG job, the PAYG income will also be verified from the ATO
 NOA’s only. If the PAYG employment commenced after the period covered by the
 ATO NOAs, and the income is required for serviceability assessment, then
 Fast Track is **not** available and one of
 the [Fully verified self\-employed assessment](#R_Fully_verified_SE_standard_assessment_)
 policies must be used.  

  

 The **only** exception
 where income can be considered that is not captured in the ATO NOA’s held is
 rental income where the rental income commenced, after the financial years
 covered by the ATO NOA’s provided. In this instance investment property
 expenses must be identified and included in\-line with Living Expenses
 policy.   

  

 When the applicant has investment properties that earned rental income
 during the ATO NOA period (either part of, or the entire period), then it is
 acceptable to load a $0 investment property expense for this real estate, as
 the expenses are already captured in the ATO NOA taxable income
 figure.  In this scenario the following comment, or similar, must be
 entered as the $0 expense explanation:  

*“Nil investment property expenses captured as the rental property was owned during the period covered by the ATO NOAs (or part thereof), and the rental expenses are factored into the total taxable income figure sourced from the ATO NOA.”*  

  

Notes: 
* When a property is only rented for part of the period covered by the ATO
 NOA’s no annualisation of rental income is permitted under Fast Track and
 there is no expectation to load additional investment property
 expenses.  If rental income of this nature requires annualisation for
 the serviceability assessment then Fast Track is
 **not** available and one of the [Fully verified self\-employed assessment](#R_Fully_verified_SE_standard_assessment_)
 policies must be used.
* When the ATO NOA shows franking credits, no adjustment of the taxable income is required to account for the franking credit. A franking credit must not be added to or subtracted from the Taxable income figure.
* When serviceability is assessed under the Fast Track method, a self\-employed entity (e.g. company or trust) must not be included separately in the serviceability assessment, and verification of any commitments related to the company and / or Trust (with corporate trustee) is not required.


**Exception authorities do not extend to Fast Track eligibility criteria.**  

  
 #### 2\.4\.1 Eligibility criteria – Fast track self\-employed assessment


Applicant has been Self\-employed for more than 2 full financial years; and 
* Borrower type \- individual, joint applicants, individuals as trustee for a
 trust, joint applicants as trustee for a trust

 policy)
* Income to be assessed from **2 years** ATO Notice
 of Assessments that meet age of document requirements. It is mandatory to
 hold all pages of the ATO NOAs for Fast Track Self\-employed

* The **only** self\-employed income
 verification documents that have been provided to the bank
 or held on file (within age of document requirements) are

 minimum of two full financial years
* Any capital gains income on the ATO NOA are excluded and must be deducted for income assessment
* Where rental income commenced, after the financial years covered by the ATO
 NOA’s:
	+ Evidence\# is required to confirm the property was
	 acquired, or the property was only rented, after the end of the
	 financial years ATO NOA's held. ( Evidence of the purchase date
	 of the property may be via a Conveyancers Settlement Statement or
	 for existing customers, a prior mortgage application ); and
	+ Rental income must be assessed inline with Verifying income policy.
	 Refer [Verifying Income](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000721) *\> Rules you must apply \> Supplementary Income*
* Negative Gearing / Tax deductibility can only be considered where rental
 income commenced after the financial years covered by the ATO NOA. Where
 Negative Gearing can be considered refer to  *[Serviceability Assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710) \> Rules you must apply \> Rental income tax
 deductions for Australian investment properties* (Negative Gearing)
* Loan is **not** Mortgage Insured


\#If evidence of the purchase date,
 or commencement date of the rental contract
 is **unable** to be supplied, the
 rental income is to be removed from the application / serviceability
 calculation. In addition, no tax deduction is allowed.   

  

    
 #### 2\.4\.2 Exclusion criteria – Fast track self\-employed assessment


Where the following apply the Fast Track process cannot be used: 
* Application has mortgage insurance
* The bank is provided with or holds any self\-employed
 income verification documents (within age of document
 requirements) **other** than the ATO
 NOAs.
* Foreign income is received by the applicant
* Undistributed company profit is required in addition to the Fast Track
 income to meet serviceability. **Note:** Dividends (either from own company or other ASX shares)
 and / or Trust distribution income included in the applicants’ ATO NOAs is
 acceptable and should not be adjusted in any way.
* Rental income has been entered separately in the loan application
 **and** it has been earned in any year covered by
 the ATO Notice of Assessment provided
* Applicant has been self\-employed for less than 2 full financial years
* ATO Notice of assessments used do not match applicants time as self\-employed.


In some cases Credit may decide the application needs to be assessed
 using one of the [Fully verified self\-employed assessment](#R_Fully_verified_SE_standard_assessment_) policy
 criteria, where this occurs the applicant will need to provide additional
 information.  

  

 Where applicants are unable to satisfy
 **all** of the above conditions the
 applicant must be assessed using one of the [Fully verified self\-employed assessment](#R_Fully_verified_SE_standard_assessment_) policy
 criteria.  

  

**Note:** Where there are multiple
 self\-employed applicants and the applicants receive income from the same
 self\-employed business or if any of the self\-employed entities are inter linked
 ( between the applicants ), then the income must be verified using the same
 assessment method.  It is however acceptable to verify one applicant under
 Fast Track and another applicant under one of the [Fully verified self\-employed assessment](#R_Fully_verified_SE_standard_assessment_)
 policies when their business entities are completely independent of each
 other and the applicants do not receive income from the same entity.  

  

 Where 2 or more applicants share investment properties, and they are
 assessed by different assessment methods (i.e. applicant 1 is Fast Track and
 applicant 2 is PAYG or applicant 1 is Fast Track and Applicant 2 is Fully
 verified self\-employed) any shared rental income cannot be entered for the
 non Fast Track applicant to ensure it is not double counted or
 overinflated.  If the non Fast Track applicant’s share of rent is
 required to meet serviceability then the Fast Track applicant must be
 assessed using one of the [Fully verified self\-employed assessment](#R_Fully_verified_SE_standard_assessment_) policies.   

  
 #### 2\.4\.3 Serviceability Assessment – Fast track self\-employed assessment


The income used for serviceability assessment is outlined in the table
 below:  

   


| Income used for serviceability assessment \- Fast track |
| --- |
| When most recent year’s income is lower than the prior year, serviceability assessment will use the most recent year’s income. |
| When the most recent year’s income is higher than the prior year, serviceability will be based on the average of the most recent year’s and the prior year’s income. |
|


  

 ### 2\.5 Accountants letter


**Accountants letter / Accountants email advice mandatory requirements**   

An Accountants letter or Accountants email advice may only be used to

Upload to OBP the search result. The Tax  Practitioner Board (TPB) number may be  required to perform this search, so it is  preferable for the TPB Number be included on  the Accountant Letter / email, however, this  is not mandatoryprovided  the registration can still be validated as  current via the TPB website  above. * Validate that the letter has addressed all the below requirements. If the letter does not address all the below criteria or when tax returns / financials for the entity are held the letter is unacceptable and cannot be used. | |

 ### 3\. Frequently Asked Questions \- FAQs


  

 

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| My customer was running a lawn mowing franchise in 2017  / 2018 financial year and is now a finance broker in  2018/2019\.    They have greater than 2 years history of being  self\-employed and more than 2 years of financials, so why  would I need to refer my application to Credit? | The self\-employed industry / field **is not** the same, so this is not  considered continuous. This does not qualify under self\-employed  policy. If an exception is supported, the loan application must  be referred to credit with supporting mitigating reasons  outlined |
| If I don't need the income from my customer's company  for servicing, why do I need to get the financials? | Financials are required to ensure the entity was not running at a loss, the income paid to the individual is sustainable and has not been paid from an unsuitable source, e.g. as prior year retained profit or profit from sale of an asset. |
| How would my customer be negatively impacted by their  company making a loss? Isn't the company a separate  entity? | A trading / operating entity cannot sustain a loss indefinitely. Distributions made to the individual or other entities would not be sustainable so the income would not be acceptable. It is assumed the individual is propping up the entity keeping it afloat attempting to trade out of the loss. |
| If my tax returns show a dependant, but the customer says they have no dependants, do I need to comment in the assessment notes? | Yes, if your supporting documents indicate a dependant,  then your assessment notes are to explain why you have not  included the dependant for serviceability assessment.  Refer to: * [Living expenses](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000700) \> *Rules \> definition of a dependant* * Loan Application and Approval \> Validation of information provided by the customer |
| How do I know what commitments my business, company or trust have? | There are a number of ways to obtain information about both assets and liabilities (commitments): * Customer interview * Completion of finance application * Review of profit and loss statements and balance sheet * Regular outgoings on statements     If your supporting documents conflict with the information  provided by the customer, then remember to either amend the  load or include an explanation in your assessment  notes. |
| If my customer has been trading for less than a year and I don't need the income for serviceability, (because the proposed new loan services on the PAYG applicant’s income only), why does the Bank need information about the self\-employed entity and to evidence if the business is trading at a profit? | Even for a newly established entity, there may have been  debts or commitments that would impact the household's  ability to borrow personally.   A new business may not yet, be generating enough income to  pay commitments and may be reliant on the PAYG individual  helping to fund any shortfall.    We want to help customers achieve their financial goals whilst continuing to be responsible lenders. |


  

 ### 4\. Completing ABN, business name or company searches


To determine if an applicant is an owner or part owner of a Company a
 Broker should review the applicants Credit Bureau report. This credit bureau
 report will show any related directorships.  

  

 While the Directors of the company have responsibility for the day to day
 management, we need to also consider who the shareholders are of the company
 when determining what income we can use in the loan assessment, i.e. share
 of profit based on being a director and percentage of shareholding. A
 company search will reflect the applicants current Shareholding of that
 entity, in addition to documenting any change(s) to shareholders and/or
 shareholdings since establishment of the company, where applicable.  

  

 If the related entity is to a business trading name (e.g. Bluey's
 convenience store) but not a company (e.g. Blue Star Pty Ltd), then a
 business name search will reflect the applicant's relationship to the
 business.  

  

An ABN search can confirm if the ABN is active, how long the ABN has been active and the GST registration status. Complete an ABN search using ABN Look\-up via [www.abr.business.gov.au](http://www.abr.business.gov.au/). 
* Where the search result shows the ABN is 'cancelled' or 'in\-active':
	+ Include a comment in AOLand;
	+ Upload the ABN search to AOL.


If the applicant discloses the entity has commitments or if it is
 evident via the Bank's systems, the commitments must be included in the
 serviceability assessment.  See example of non\- trading entity verified by ABN search  

  

When the application is assessed under Fast Track, an ABN search is
 required on all self\-employed entities the applicant derives an income from,
 to confirm the self\-employed entities have been established and trading for
 a minimum of two full financial years.  

  

**Note**: only the ABN search is required under
 Fast Track, a company directorship search is not
 required.   

  

  
 ### 5\. Guide to understanding changes to business profitability and recording supporting rationale for Fully verified \- latest year assessment


  

 It is best practice to record factors relating to the assessment of self\-employed /
 business income in all cases.   

  

 When assessing serviceability based on the latest year self\-employed income and the
 two years average income is \>130% of the prior years income, it is mandatory to
 review the business financials and to enter supporting comments to explain:
 * Why there has been a change from the prior year.
* How the change to business profit is sustainable into the future.
* Why the income can be used for serviceability assessment.


 Supporting comments should refer to the appropriate items in the financials / tax returns where possible and may also be supported by customer conversations and additional supporting documents if appropriate.   

  

There are many factors which can affect the profitability of business
 income / self\-employed applicants. This guide outlines some common scenarios
 which may be the reason for the change in profitability.   

  

 It is not an exhaustive list of scenarios and each source of self\-employed
 income will have its own unique story. These scenarios are provided to
 help guide you to have an insightful conversation with the borrower about
 why the business has experienced changes to profitability.   

  

**Scenarios**  

When reviewing the financial information provided by the borrower if the
 latest years income is higher than the prior year’s income we should try to
 identify if the change is due to a reduction in expenses or an increase in
 sales.  

   


| Increase in sales  When the increase in net profit is due to an increase in sales, a Broker / Assessor must understand how this increase occurred and if this is sustainable. In addition to understanding how a business has increased the net profit, a Broker / Assessor should also consider potential industry or market changes that are likely to have an adverse impact on the business. To use an extreme example, during COVID\-19 many restrictions were imposed which had a severe impact to industries such as tourism, retail, and hospitality, just to name a few. | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario | Issues to consider / Potential implications | What do I need to do? |
| Increase in demand for the products / services the business offers | How sustainable is the increase in demand?     For Example * The business released a new product or service, and the new product / service is now part of the permanent suite of products / services the business offers. The new product / service has proven to be very popular and has resulted in higher trade, with trends in trade showing no signs of slowing demand. * If the increase in demand is due to a ‘once off’ sale (including discontinuing a product line and selling the remaining stock at a reduced price), this would not be considered sustainable. | * Contact the borrower **and ask them** what they see as the benefits  or disadvantages of the change. * In your loan assessment notes explain: 	+ Why there has been a change. Include details of the discussion with the customer. 	+ How the change to business profit is sustainable into the future. 	+ Why the income can be used for serviceability assessment. * Upload to ApplyOnline any supporting documentation you may have obtained from the customer. |
| The business increased the price of its goods / services. | Is the price increase permanent? Is the price increase  competitive within the marketplace? Do competitors offer the  same or a better product / service at a cheaper price?     For example     Has the business lost any customers / contracts as a result  of the price increase? * Usually, a price increase would be intended to be permanent however what if the business competitors offer the same product / service at a reduced cost. If the competitors do not increase their price, then the business may be at risk of losing customers and may need to reduce the price to complete. While the current year may show an increase in net profit this may not be sustainable into the future as customers leave. If the business has not lost any customers as a result, this is a good outcome but what supports the change as being sustainable? * To ensure the business would not lose existing contracts, the business explored what their competitors offered. As well as increasing prices they added an extra feature to the product / service. The cost of the extra feature was negligible and factored into the price change. With the enhanced product / service the business has attracted more customers since making the change. They are benefiting from both the increased sales and change to profit margin. |


  

 

| **Reduction in expenses**  When the increase in net profit is a result of a  reduction in expenses Brokers / Assessors should seek to  understand if the reduction in expenses, is a once off or  long\-term cost reduction. When the reduction in expenses is  a long\-term cost reduction, then the loan assessment notes  need to address how the reduction is sustainable and if this  is expected to have any adverse impacts on the  business. | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario | Issues to consider / Potential implications | What do I need to do? |
| The business has relocated premises and secured cheaper rent. | How will the relocation of the business impact the  customers?     For example * The business is a retail outlet and they have moved from a street frontage location on a busy street where they received a lot of walk\-in customers. The new premises, has no street frontage and has low foot traffic passing by. What benefits or disadvantages come with moving? Will they save on the rent but need to increase advertising costs to attract customers? Or have they decided they will target more online sales to counter the loss of foot traffic? If the business has fundamentally changed its target market (example: from walk in sales to online sales) then a cautious approach needs to be taken until the change has proven successful and sustainable. * If the premises, is a warehouse / storage facility and not a customer facing site, the change of location may not have an adverse impact. | * Contact the borrower **and ask them** what they see as the benefits  or disadvantages of the change. * In your loan assessment notes explain: 	+ Why there has been a change. Include details of the discussion with the customer. 	+ How the change to business profit is sustainable into the future. 	+ Why the income can be used for serviceability assessment. * Upload to ApplyOnline any supporting documentation you may have obtained from the customer. |
| The business has reduced staff costs or terminated employees. | Can the business generate the same level of sales /  turnover with less staff?     For example:     If the business has terminated a staff member, what job role  did that staff member fulfil and who is now completing that  work? E.g. * If the staff member was the sole or highest achieving salesperson, will the business be able to sell its products / services effectively without this person? If the business owner themselves will take over the role, who will now cover the activities they were previously undertaking? Could there be a loss or run off of existing customers due to loyal customers following the prior sales person? * What if the business was a logistics company and the terminated staff member was the sole truck driver, how will deliveries be made? |
| The business reduced expenses by stopping an expense such as a hire purchase for example. | What did this expense relate to?     Did the expense cease because a loan term was  completed?     Did the business stop hiring / leasing equipment /  machinery?     For example * If the expense related to hiring equipment / machinery, how will the business continue to generate the same level of profit without this equipment / machinery? * If a loan term reached completion, has the funded asset also reached the end of its life? Does the asset now need to be replaced? |

 #### [2\.4\.1 Default shared commitment rule](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Default_shared_commitment_rule>)


Where an **existing** commitment is shared with another
 borrower ( i.e. \>1 borrower on the **existing** commitment )
 the ‘Default shared commitment rule’ requires 100% of that commitment
 amount and it’s [‘Serviceability Repayment Amount’](#R_Serviceability_Repayment_Amount) be included in the consumer mortgage application
 (aggregate) level serviceability assessment
* e.g. if a new loan / loan increase is in a sole
 name, but an existing commitment is held in joint / multiple
 names, the full amount of the existing  commitment and
 it’s associated [‘Serviceability Repayment Amount’](#R_Serviceability_Repayment_Amount) must be applied against the
 sole borrower.


If serviceability fails due to the ‘Default shared commitment rule’, the application may be considered using the following options:
* Apportioned household expenses and shared commitments \- Spousal same household
* Apportioned shared commitment rule


  

**[2\.5 Apportioned household expenses and shared commitments and Apportioned shared commitments](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.5 Apportioned household expenses and shared commitments and Apportioned shared commitments>)**  

  
 #### 2\.5\.1 Apportioned household expenses and shared commitments \- Spousal same household


  

 

| Definition | This policy option allows the  borrower’s serviceability to be assessed using their [apportioned share](#Apportioning the household living expense or commitment ) of:* household living expenses (both HEM comparable and non – HEM comparable expenses), and * repayments for any **existing** shared  commitments (i.e. debts / liabilities) |
| --- | --- |
| Eligibility | * The borrower’s spouse must not be a  borrower or income reliant guarantor on the  consumer mortgage application being  assessed,  **and** * The borrower and the borrower’s  spouse must **live at the same address,** **and** * The **only** borrowers on any  **existing** shared commitments must  be the borrower and the borrower’s  spouse  This policy option is not available when:* the application is processed outside of OBP, or * the **existing** commitment or  **proposed** consumer mortgage  application being assessed has a company  co\-borrower, or * borrowers on the **existing**  shared commitment are not spouse only or do  not fit the banks definition of a  household, or * either borrower of the  **existing** commitment or proposed  consumer mortgage application being assessed  earns foreign  income  Where the borrower is not eligible for this  policy, they may meet the requirements for the [Apportioned shared commitments rule](#R_Apportioned_shared_commitment_rule) |
| [Apportioning the household living expense or commitment](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#Apportioning the household living expense or commitment >) | The portion of the expense or  commitment repayment used in the serviceability  assessment is based on the [borrower’s contribution to the total household income.](#Evidencing the borrower’s contribution to the total household income )  i.e. calculating the borrower’s income as a  percentage of the total household income (i.e. borrower  \+ spouse income), and applying that same percentage to  the shared household living expenses and  commitments.   When OBP is the assessment tool, the apportioned  household expenses and shared commitments calculations  will be automatically completed (including HEM  value).  Lenders / assessors do not need to manually adjust the borrower’s percentage ownership or amount of an expense or a commitment. |
| Evidencing the borrower’s contribution to the total household income | * The borrower’s contribution to household income must be evidenced by verifying both the borrower and non\-borrower’s (borrower’s spouse) income. * The non\-borrower (borrower's spouse) must be verified using the following income verification method:  	+ PAYG must be verified 	 using standard income verification 	 policy. Refer to [Verifying Income](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000721) policy. 	+ Self Employed non\-borrower 	 must be verified using Fast Track 	 self\-employed assessment. The full 	 Fast Track policy including 	 ‘Eligibility’ and ‘Exclusion’ 	 criteria applies. Refer to [Self Employed Applicants](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000708) policy. |
| DTI | The **entire**  commitment value (higher of balance/limit)   is used in the DTI calculation (not the  apportioned value) |
| HEM | The HEM band calculation is determined on total household income and does not change when using the apportioned household expense policy. |
| Verification | The broker must:* Comply with [Commitments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690)  policy * Sight the non\-borrower spouse privacy and consent, identification, and income verification documents AND: * upload documentation (to OBP) confirming : 1. The borrower’s spouse resides at the  same address as the borrower;  **and** 2. The name of the borrower’s spouse matches the employee’s name on the income documents used to verify the borrower’s spouse income, including the ATO notice of assessment where the borrower’s spouse is self\-employed. |

#### [2\.5\.2 Apportioned shared commitment rule](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Apportioned_shared_commitment_rule>)


#### 




| Definition | This policy option:* can be used when serviceability fails  based on the [‘Default shared commitment rule’](#R_Default_shared_commitment_rule) * allows the borrower’s or income reliant  guarantor’s  serviceability to be assessed  using their apportioned share of repayments  for an **existing** shared commitment (i.e.  debts / liabilities) | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Eligibility | The  borrower(s) or income guarantor(s) (WBC  only) share an existing commitment with  another borrower **who is not**:* The spouse of the  borrower and not a co\-borrower  on the new loan or loan  variation being  assessed, **or** * An income guarantor (WBC only) on the new loan or loan variation being assessed  Apportioned shared commitment  rule  is **not** available  when:* the application is processed outside of OBP * The new loan or shared commitment has a company co\-borrower * Foreign income is used in the serviceability assessment * Any co\-borrower / income guarantor (WBC only) of the shared commitment resides outside of Australia * The existing commitment is shared between spouses only: 	+ If the 	 borrower and 	 non\-borrower spouse 	 reside at the same 	 address, refer 	 to [Apportioned household expenses and shared commitments – Spousal same household policy](#2.4.1 •	Apportioned household expenses and shared commitments - Spousal same household) 	+ If the borrower and non\-borrower spouse reside at different addresses, the borrower has to take on the full responsibility for both their own as well as the spouse’s portion of the debt. | |
| Calculation | The applicant’s apportioned share of the commitment used in serviceability assessment is based on the highest of the below categories | |
| Category | Description |
| A. Repayment percentage | The percentage of the total minimum  required loan repayment that the borrower(s) or  income guarantor(s) plus their spouse (if  their spouse is not a party on the new consumer mortgage  application  or loan variation being assessed) are  liable.   This is a customer declared percentage.   E.g. Existing borrowers \= Borrower 'A' \+ Borrower 'A'  Spouse (who is not a party on the new consumer mortgage  application  or loan variation being assessed)  \+  Other borrower who is not a party on the new  consumer mortgage application  or loan variation  being assessed.   The declared repayment percentage for Borrower 'A'  plus their spouse was 50%.  **Note:** the declared  percentage is below the borrower percentage in this  scenario. |
| B. Borrower Percentage | The borrower(s) or income guarantor  ( plus their spouse (if their spouse is not  a party on the new consumer mortgage application or loan  variation being assessed) as a percentage of total  borrowers.   E.g. Existing borrowers \= Borrower 'A' \+ Borrower 'A'  Spouse (who is not a party on the new consumer mortgage  application  or loan variation being assessed)  \+ Other borrower who is not a party on the new  consumer mortgage application  or loan variation  being assessed.   Borrower 'A' plus their spouse represent  66\.66% of total borrowers (This percentage is  based on the equal distribution of the commitment  amongst all borrowers on the existing  commitment) |
| C. Asset ownership percentage   (Only applies where an asset secures the existing  facility) | The borrower(s) or income  guarantor(s) plus their spouse’s ownership  of any assets securing the existing   commitment     This is a customer declared percentage   E.g. Existing borrowers \= Borrower 'A' owns 20% \+  Borrower 'A' Spouse owns 60% (if their spouse  is not a party on the new consumer mortgage  application  or loan variation being assessed)  \+  Other borrower who is not a party on the  new consumer mortgage application  or loan  variation being assessed owns the remaining 20%.   Borrower 'A' plus their spouse own 80% of  the asset securing the existing facility  **Note**: in this scenario the  asset ownership percentage is higher than the repayment  percentage and the borrower  percentage. |
| Example | Using the examples above, if:* 100% of the associated [‘Serviceability Repayment Amount’](#R_Serviceability_Repayment_Amount) under the ‘[Default shared commitment rule’](#R_Default_shared_commitment_rule) is $3,000,  then  the associated [‘Serviceability Repayment Amount’](#R_Serviceability_Repayment_Amount) if using the ‘[Apportioned shared commitment rule’](#R_Apportioned_shared_commitment_rule), would be $2,400 using  C. Assets ownership percentage of 80%, as this  is the highest percentage in the above  examples. | |
| DTI | The  **entire** commitment value (higher of  balance/limit)  is used in the DTI  calculation (not the apportioned value) | |
| Verification | The broker must:  * Comply with [Commitments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690)  policy | |
| Related [Serviceability Assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710) policy | The commitment type must allow an apportioned serviceability repayment amount. To identify if the commitment is eligible to be apportioned, refer to following sections in this chapter:* Serviceability repayment amount * Benchmark repayment amount – Mortgage 	+ Benchmark repayment amount calculation – New and existing internal mortgage 	+ Benchmark repayment amount calculation – External existing mortgage | |




 


  

 #### **[2\.5\.3 Serviceability Repayment Amount](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Serviceability_Repayment_Amount>)**


The *Serviceability Repayment Amount* is the repayment amount which is ultimately used within the serviceability assessment. The repayment amount is determined by the type of liability and can be either: 

 * *Benchmark Repayment Amount \-* refers to repayment value which
 has been calculated by the Bank for serviceability purposes only
* *Customer Declared Contracted Repayment Amount \-* refers
 to the contracted repayment amount for the commitment as declared
 by the customer
* The higher of the commitment **current** balance or limit is
 used in the *Benchmark Repayment Amount* calculation, except where
 the below apply:
	+ Commitment being refinanced using loan funds
	+ Amended current commitment
* Loans originated concurrently, or existing loans with a concurrent loan activity, it is important that the correct repayment is assigned to the associated liability in each application

| Scenarios – Outgoing rent or outgoing board1. Where the borrower and their spouse (non\-borrower on the new loan) rent a property together, then the total contracted rental amount and 100% ownership of the expense must be entered against the borrower.   Where [Apportioned household expense and shared commitments – Spousal same household](#2.4.1 Apportioned household expenses and shared commitments - Spousal same household) policy is being utilised, you will need to  include the entire rental outgoing amount as an expense.

Include notes in the application to describe  the scenario clearly for the Assessor. 2. Where the borrower and their spouse (non\-borrower on the new loan), rent a property with 1 other person, then the borrower’s and their spouse’s share of the total contracted rent must be entered, e.g. 3 tenants on the lease, then the borrower’s and their spouse’s share of the rent is 66%.

The borrower and their  spouse rent a property and are  applying for a new loan in joint  names. The total contracted  rent may be loaded in full against  either borrower, or split between  both borrowers, providing the total  contracted rental outgo is entered  and the combined expense ownership  reflects 100%. [Apportioned household expense and shared commitments \- Spousal same household](#2.4.1 Apportioned household expenses and shared commitments - Spousal same household) policy does not  apply in this instance as it is a  joint borrower application. 4. The borrower rents a property with 2 other people (non\-spousal), who are not co\-borrowers on the new loan application. It is acceptable to enter the borrower’s share of the total contracted rent based on the number of tenants on the lease, e.g. 3 tenants on the lease, then the borrower’s share of the rent is 33%. This can be entered as: 	* 33% of the total contracted rental outgo amount and 100% expense ownership, or 	* The total 	 contracted rental outgo 	 amount and 33% expense 	 ownership     5. The borrower and co\-borrower (non\-spousal) on the new loan application rent a property together and are both on the lease. An amount or expense ownership percentage equivalent to 50% of the total contracted rental outgo must be entered against each borrower, i.e. this can be entered as: 	* 50% of the total contracted rental outgo amount and 100% expense ownership against each borrower, or 	* The total contracted rental outgo amount and 50% expense ownership against each borrower | | | | | |

| Definition | The HEM, developed by the Melbourne Institute, represents a broad based estimated level of absolute basic and discretionary expenditure for modern Australian households and is produced Quarterly.  The HEM is applied by the loan origination system and other serviceability assessment tools |
| --- | --- |
| Used for | It is an index used by the Bank to set the minimum surplus rule for serviceability. May be used for the allocation of living expenses within an application —see Monthly Household Expenditure Measure Table |
| Categorised according to | * Borrower income band * Geographical location of the borrower’s place of residence (including overseas residence) * Marital status * Number of dependants *(refer to* Living Expenses*policy)* |
| Rules | * The geographical location is based on the borrower’s residential postcode post loan settlement \- see Monthly Household Expenditure Measure \- Geographic location. * The post settlement postcode is mandatory to calculate HEM. If the application is an In Principal Approval, the post settlement postcode is to be captured as accurately as possible. * Applicant's gross income for the HEM band is calculated based on the total: 	+ Gross annual 	 salary / wages income 	 (unshaded) **plus** 	+ Gross annual 	 rental income 	 (unshaded) **less** thehigher 	 of(customer 	 declared investment property 	 costs or 10% of gross 	 unshaded rental 	 income) **less** investment 	 loan interest costs (where 	 negative gearing has been 	 used) 	 **plus** 	+ All other gross annual income (unshaded) |

### 


#### 2\.8\.1 Monthly Household Expenditure Measure \- Table


  

Minimum surplus requirements are set out below based on HEM
 Quarter information shown in the HEM Tables. Source: Melbourne
 Institute.  

  

 The HEM table includes a split by applicant’s \*household income,
 geographical location, marital status and number of dependants.  

    

 To manually calculate the HEM value: 
1. Calculate


* Gross annual salary / wages income (unshaded)
 **plus**
* Gross annual rental income (unshaded)
 **less** investment property
 operating costs/expenses **less**
 investment loan interest costs (where negative gearing has been used)
 **plus**
* all other gross annual income (unshaded)


1. Determine if applicants post settlement postcode is classified as ‘HEM Remote postcode’ or not
2. To determine the applicable HEM value, go to the Monthly Household Expenditure Measure Table taking into account:


* Income as calculated above at step 1\.
* Geographical location based on the applicant’s post settlement postcode from step 3\.
* Marital status
* Number of dependants\*In the case of ‘Joint with Spouse’ applicants living in the same household, a combined HEM household income is used to determine the HEM band to be used. For other applicant’s, the individual HEM household income is used to determine the applicable HEM band.


  

The table below provides details of how the HEM values apply.  

   


| Marital Status | Spouse’s Status | HEM Table |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single / Divorced / Widowed / Separated / Undisclosed | N/A | Use table 1 (Single) |
| Married / De Facto | Spouse is neither a borrower or an  **income guarantor on the loan being assessed** | Use table 2 (Joint) |
| Spouse is a borrower or an **income guarantor on the loan being assessed** and living in  the same household | Use table 3 (Joint with Spouse) |
| Spouse is a borrower or an **income guarantor** **on the loan being assessed** and living in  a different household | Use table 1 (Single) |


  

[HEM tables](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/ci/okcsFattach/getFile/1000710/03.17%20HEM%20Table.xlsx)  

  

For household incomes greater than $614k gross per annum the loan origination system platform will extrapolate the HEM value using the following calculation:
* (Household Income amount / Mid\-point of top HEM band) x (Top band HEM value – Second Top band HEM value) \+ Second Top band HEM value).

For the purposes of assessing the borrower(s) and (any) income guarantor(s) capacity to repay the Bank, the higher of Household Expenditure Measure (HEM) and Customer Declared 'Living Expenses compared to HEM' per household will be used.  

  

Refer to [Living Expenses \>](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>) [Living Expenses compared to HEM](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000700)

 When the total of the borrower’s declared 'Living Expenses compared to HEM' are less than 70% of HEM
 at application level, brokers / assessors must:  

 * Discuss the declared level of expenses with the
 applicant(s) noting that they appear relatively low. (Refer
 to  [Living Expenses](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000700)  \> Conflicting
 information)
* For all expense categories, undertake any relevant / appropriate scrutiny of account or transactional information, and make further enquiries where any information is identified which conflicts with the customer declared expenses
	+ Ensure any expense fields entered as $0 had commentary added to explain why the expense does not apply to the applicants
* Record the outcome of these discussions with the applicant(s) in the loan origination system to document the rationale behind why the expenses are low. Refer to Rational examples below.
* It is not a requirement to obtain further supporting documents to specifically validate this information.


 **Rational**  **examples**   

  
 

| Satisfactory rationale examples | Unsatisfactory rationale examples |
| --- | --- |
| Customer declared living expenses are \< 70% of HEM, customer has confirmed expenses are low due to: * currently focusing on saving for construction in the future * both applicants are working from home with scheduled breaks, they can pick and drop their kids to school which allow them to save from Out of School Hours Care (OSHC) costs * living at home with parents and do not pay any other insurances or utilities * confirmed with customer that Customer declared expenses are accurate to their everyday spending, review of information held supports conversation | * Expense check complete * Discussed expenses with customer * Ok to proceed |

### [2\.9 Reverse Mortgage Loans](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.9 Bridging / Relocation and Reverse Mortgage Loans>)




| Definition | A reverse mortgage is designed for people aged over 60 years or older using the equity in the Owner Occupied property as security, to advance funds.  The borrower is not required to make repayments, interest and fees compound and add to the principal amount borrowed. Normally the loan is repaid in full when the borrower (or deceased estate) sells the security. |
| --- | --- |
| Verification | Applications involving an ongoing (not clearing or excluded) existing Reverse Mortgage loan must be referred to credit for acceptance. Credit manager referral is required to validate:* That the repayment used for serviceability (being $0 or Interest Only) is appropriate, taking into consideration:  	+ Whether the loan has matured 	+ Whether the loan will be maturing in the very near term 	+ Whether it is reasonable to extend further borrowing to a customer with an ongoing existing Reverse Mortgage Loan |
| Supporting Information | Detail explaining why the borrower is seeking additional borrowings as a standard loan product when they have an existing Reverse Mortgage loan |
| Supporting Documentation requirements | A copy of the associated loan contract is to be provided |

For new and existing consumer mortgage products only, an interest
 rate buffer and floor rate are considered in the Benchmark Repayment
 Amount calculation applied to the mortgage commitment, and the interest
 rate applied is the Serviceability Assessment Rate (SAR).  

   


| Interest Rate | Policy rules |
| --- | --- |
| Buffer rate | The buffer rate is determined by the Bank; it reflects the potential for interest rate increases and seeks to ensure that potential increases in interest rates do not adversely impact on a borrower’s capacity to repay a loan.  Effective 29 October 2021 the buffer  rate is  **3\.00%p.a.** |
| Floor rate | The Bank maintains a minimum floor rate which is used in conjunction with the buffer rate. The floor rate is the lowest benchmark rate that the Bank has set for testing a customer’s ability to repay the loan. **Note:**  The floor rate is also internally referred to as the  'Minimum Credit Assessment Rate (MCAR)'  Effective 9 October 2020 the floor rate is  **5\.05%**  p.a. |
| Serviceability Assessment Rate (SAR) | The SAR refers to the interest rate which is applied in the Benchmark Repayment Amount calculation. * If the final rate on the loan plus the interest rate buffer of 3\.00% p.a. is less than the floor rate, then the floor rate is applied as the SAR. * If the final rate on the loan plus the interest rate buffer of 3\.00% p.a. is greater than the floor rate, then the actual rate on the loan plus the interest rate buffer is applied as the SAR |
| **Note:** A modified SAR may be applied to applications to refinance an existing mortgage (internal or external), where the application meets all eligibility criteria and conditions under Streamlined Refinance | |


   

 Examples:  


| **Scenario** | Final rate on loan | **\+**  Buffer Rate for SAR | **\=**  Final Rate \+ Buffer for SAR | Floor rate | **SAR** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2\.0% | 3\.00% pa | 5\.00% | 5\.05% | 5\.05%  I.e. the higher floor rate applies |
| 2 | 2\.05% | 3\.00% pa | 5\.05% | 5\.05% | 5\.05%  I.e. the floor rate and final rate \+interest rate buffer  is the same. |
| 3 | 4\.0% | 3\.00% pa | 7\.00% | 5\.05% | 7\.00%  I.e. higher final rate plus interest rate buffer  applies. |

| Definition | When a borrower or income guarantor is currently on, or about to commence parental leave, we can use their ‘return to work’ income for serviceability, provided the requirements are met. |
| --- | --- |
| Exclusions | Any other extended leave like Grandparental Leave or Career Breaks are ineligible as this isn’t covered under Government Legislation like Parental Leave where a person is guaranteed for their job to be held open for 12 months. |


  

 

| **Condition** | **Requirement** |
| --- | --- |
| In all cases where ‘return income’ is to be used for serviceability | An employer’s letter is held which:* Meets [Document Standards](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000692) of ‘Employer’s letter \- general use’, and * Displays: 	+ The return to work date. 	+ Conditions under which the employee will return, i.e. Full time or Part time 	+ Return to work income as per the 	 **['Document Standards](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/ci/okcsFattach/getFile/1000692/03.08%20MDSM.xls)’**of 	 ‘Employer’s letter\-general 	 use’ * **Only** ‘Base income’ can be  used in the serviceability  assessment * Include all  children as dependants in OBP.

### [2\.12 Rental income tax deductions for Australian investment properties (Negative Gearing)](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Rental_income_tax_deductions_for_Austr>)




| Definition | Generally negative gearing occurs when  a rental property’s expenses (including interest) are  greater than income earned from the rental  property.   The Australian tax system allows individuals with rental  properties that are negatively geared, to deduct the  loss against other income (e.g. PAYG  income). | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Serviceability | * The use of negative gearing in serviceability is not mandatory | | |
| Eligibility | Negative gearing can be included in the serviceability assessment under the following conditions: | | |
| Feature | | Condition |
| Application type | | Available for both non\-mortgage insured and mortgage insured loans |
| Employment type | | * Available for both PAYG and Self Employed applicants |
| Income | | * The applicant’s income must be subject to Australian taxation law, i.e. applicant is ordinarily resident in Australia and * Loan serviceability must  **not** be assessed  using the Self\-Employed fast track process  unless the rental income commenced after the  financial years covered by the ATO NOA. Refer to  [Self\-employed Applicants \> Rules you must apply \> Fast track self\-employed assessment.](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000708) |
| Applicable to the negatively geared loan: | Interest Rate | The actual current interest rate must be used in the negative gearing calculation |
| Borrower | The deduction can only be applied to an applicant who is a borrower on the loan which is being negatively geared |
| Loan purpose | * The loan must be / have been taken out for the purpose of investing in residential real estate * For both an existing mortgage or the new loan, negative gearing benefits can be included when all or part of a loan is for the purpose of investing in the specific rental property negative gearing is being applied to |
| Deductible loan amount | Only the loan portion used for investing in the specific rental property negative gearing is being applied to can be used. The customer must declare the amount of the loan  that is eligible or that is already being negatively  geared   The amount of negative gearing used* May include:  	+ the purchase price of the property 	+ any associated costs in obtaining the investment property (e.g., stamp duty and legal costs). * Must be the lower of the  customer declared deductable loan amount  **or** the actual loan  balance |
| Verification | As per [Commitments](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690) [policy](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#>) |
| Residential property that the negative gearing applies to | | * The percentage of tax deduction for Bank serviceability purposes that an applicant may claim is based on their share of property ownership. * The property securing the loan must  **not** be vacant  land * The property must have rental income verified in line with policy and used in the serviceability assessment * The property must be owned by an  individual (**not** a partnership, company  or trust including an individual as trustee  for (ATF)) * When the property is rented on  a short term basis, a rental income tax  deduction / negative gearing can only be  applied in serviceability when the property  is already owned and the rental schedule  confirms the property was rented / available  for rent, for the full 52 weeks of the  financial year. Also see [Verifying Income](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000721) policy \> Supplementary  Income \> Rental income (in AUD) Rent  received on a short term  basis. |
| Rental arrangement | | The rental income cannot be from a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) property |


  

  

  
 ### **2\.13 Serviceability Assessment: Changes to financial circumstance**


As part of our responsible lending obligations, it is required to
 ask the customer about potential changes to their financial position
 over the next three years that would adversely affect their ability to
 meet their financial obligations under the loan.  

  

 Where such a change is expected, the customer is required to disclose:
 
* The nature of the change (see below)
* Their plans for continuing to meet the loan repayments (see below)


**Nature of the change**  

The nature of change must be captured using the following
 declaration:  

   


| Declaration question to customer |
| --- |
| Nature of Change* Is extended unpaid leave (e.g. maternity) the nature of the expected change? * Is end of contract/loss of employment the nature of the expected change? * Is reduced income the nature of the expected change? * Is retirement the nature of the expected change? * Is leaving employment the nature of the expected change? * Is medical treatment/illness the nature of the expected change? * Is increase in debt repayments the nature of the expected change? * Is large expenditure the nature of the expected change? * Is the nature of the expected change none of the above, reflected here as Other?    **Plans to meet loan repayments** * Will you continue to make repayments using savings? * Does the information captured in the application already reflect the anticipated change? * Will you continue to make repayments by securing additional income? * Will you continue to make repayments by reducing expenditure? * Will you continue to make repayments by the sale of other assets? * Will you continue to make repayments by the sale of your principal residence? * Will you continue to make repayments by other means? |


  

**Approval**
* Applications require approval from a Credit (or other authorised CAL holder)
 where:
	+ The customer advises that such a change is expected,
	 **and**
	+ The application does not already reflect the change to the customer's financial situation (i.e. the application has not been assessed on the basis of the change)


* All submissions to Credit for approval must include justification for the override request.


  

 
### [2\.14 Debt To Income (DTI) Ratio](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_Debt_To_Income_(DTI)_Ratio>)


Loan assessment measure ‘Debt To Income Ratio’ assists Westpac
 Group to apply responsible lending practices in assessing a customer’s
 ability to service existing and proposed debts.  

   
#### [2\.14\.1 DTI Ratio Calculation](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_DTI_calculation>)


   


| **Measure** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| Debt | Total of the higher of limit / balance of all borrower and Income Reliant Guarantor's new and existing liabilities excluding: * Hire purchase, Leasing, Other Liabilities * Any liabilities being cleared and closed in the submission, whether by customer or loan funds * Bridging Loans (applies to new or existing, internal or external, IO or ICAP repayments)  Where a debt is being:* educed in the submission, whether by customer or loan funds, the New limit is used in lieu of the Current Limit for DTI calculation * apportioned, the  **entire** commitment value  (higher of balance/limit)  is  used in the DTI calculation (not the  apportioned  value)  e.g. Debt \= $500,000 |
| Income | Total gross unshaded annual income from borrower/s  and **income guarantor** (WBC only)  (including gross rental income and all other income  types)     e.g. Income\= $65,000 |
| DTI Ratio Calculation | Debt ÷ Income     e.g. $500,000 (Debt) ÷ $65,000 (Income)\= 7\.69 DTI  ratio |


    

 #### [2\.14\.2 High DTI Ratio \- Commentary and Referral to Credit](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#R_DTI_Referral_to_Credit>)


 OBP will return a DTI ratio Credit referral rule where:

 * the DTI ratio is equal to or greater than seven (7\) and
 less than ten (10\) **and:**
	+ the LVR is greater than 80%,
	 **and/or**
	+ LMI applies
* the DTI ratio is equal to or greater than ten (10\).


 In all instances where the DTI ratio is equal to or greater than seven (7\),
 brokers/assessors must provide appropriate notes and comments in their submission to
 the effect that:  

 * They have discussed the level of debt to income with the borrower(s) noting the debt level appears relatively high
* They have identified any specific circumstances that are contributing to the high DTI result, such as other income not able to be included in the DTI calculation
* Where any other policy rules have been triggered in addition to DTI, that valid mitigants can be demonstrated
* They have validated the customers’ ability to meet repayments on the proposed loan noting the high DTI ratio
* They have documented any other relevant rationale to support why the deal should still be approved


    

 Where the application triggers a Credit referral, Credit will review the application
 with consideration applied to:
 * the notes and comments in the submission
* the LVR, level of monthly surplus, credit history (including anything adverse on their credit bureau) and level of income
* any other policy exceptions or rules triggered


  

 ### 2\.15 Judgemental assessment


Some customers may exhibit circumstances where their financial situation needs to be considered as an exception by Credit ( or other authorised CAL holder ).

### 3\.1 Assessing Base Income




| Base income* Be aware YTD income figures on a payslip may be provided as YTD total gross earnings (being income prior to tax or other pre\-tax deductions) or YTD total taxable earnings (being after pre\-tax deductions). Where the payslip provides both figures, use the YTD total gross earnings figure in the employer income calculator | |
| --- | --- |
| [Base Income](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#P_Base_income_Payslips>) * Payslips  Also see: * [verifying](#R_S_or_W_Base_income_-_payslips) | Add income as **Base Salary.** If income documents indicate any pre\-tax deductions, refer to [Process \> *Salary Sacrifice / Fringe Benefit deduction / Pre\-Tax deductions*](#P_Salary_Sacrifice_Fringe_Benefit_Pre_ta) |
| [Base income](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#P_Base_income_Direct_salary_Credits>) * Direct salary credits  Also see: * [Verifying](#R_S_or_W_Base_income_-_direct_salary_cre) | 1\. Use the employer income calculator, ensure you complete the fields: * Income verification type \> **Account Credits** * Net pay amount. If salary credits differ the lower amount is to be used to annualise income  2\. The calculator will: * Determine base * Provide gross income amount to enter into ApplyOnline  3\. Create a PDF copy of the employer income  calculator outcome and retain the PDF in the file.  4\. If a loan application is referred to Credit a copy of the  calculation must be available with the loan documentation  for reference. |
| [Salary Sacrifice or Fringe Benefit deduction or Pre\-Tax deduction Note](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#P_Salary_Sacrifice_Fringe_Benefit_Pre_ta>): If  the salary sacrifice deduction is not required  to be included in gross income for serviceability  calculations,  it is acceptable to proceed with the lower income  figure.   In these instances you must still include any commitment or  living expense which is related to the deduction  amount.   Also see: * [Verifying](#R_S_or_W_Salary_Sac_deductions) | **In all cases** Complete the fields within the employer income  calculator tool as per the specific income scenario until  you reach the "Salary Sacrifice" fields, then refer to below  for individual deduction type:   **For Additional Superannuation Contributions** **Steps**   1**.**  Review the payslip and identify the Superannuation Guarantee  (SG) contribution amount and the voluntary additional  superannuation contribution.  If the payslip only shows  a single superannuation deduction, then further  investigation is required.  If it is identified that  the superannuation deduction relates solely to the SG  amount, then do not proceed further.   Where you have confirmed the deduction is a voluntary  superannuation contribution, proceed to step 2\.   2\. Have the applicant complete the Salary Sacrifice  Declaration form. Check the form has been completed in line  with requirements as per [Rules](#R_S_or_W_Salary_Sac_deductions) [\> Base income  **\>**](#R_S_or_W_Salary_Sac_deductions) [Salary Sacrifice, Fringe Benefit deduction, Pre\-tax deductions](#R_S_or_W_Salary_Sac_deductions)  Notes: You cannot use the salary sacrificed income for serviceability calculations if the applicant has not: * indicated the deduction is voluntary 9i.e.  because it relates to a compuslroy super  contribution); **and** * indicated the deduction can be cancelled at  any time and received as taxable income;  **and** * confirmed (where policy requires this declaration) that they would cancel the deduction if required to meet their existing commitments and the repayments for the loan they have requested.   3\. In the employer income calculator,  **ensure you complete the fields**: * Pre\-tax deductions required for servicing? **Yes / No** * Pre\-tax deduction \> Input the actual amount from the payslip. (The amount field must be completed even where the income is not used for serviceability assessment)  **Note:** The  salary sacrifice (pre\-tax deduction) amount loaded must be  \>\=$0\. All salary sacrifice fields displayed are to be  completed. For example, where more than single years  documents are obtained complete both the Current Year and  Prior Year columns.  Where there has been a change to  base income, the pre\-tax deduction amount prior to the base  increase must also be entered.  The salary sacrifice  amount can vary depending on the applicant's salary  sacrifice arrangements at any point in time.   4\. If a PAYG Payment Summary or ATO Income  Statement is required in the income calculation the  amount shown at "Reportable employer superannuation  contributions" may be added to the "Gross payments"  amount.   5\. The calculator will: * Determine base and non\-base income * Provide gross income amount to enter into ApplyOnline * Provide an Annual gross income amount to enter into ApplyOnline * Provide an Annual 'Bonus' amount to enter into ApplyOnline   6\. Create a PDF copy of the employer  income calculator outcome and retain the PDF in the  file. Assessment notes are to be completed and provide a  clear explanation regarding the income used for  serviceability assessment and compliance with this  policy.   7\. If a loan application is referred to Credit a copy of the  calculation must be available with the loan documentation  for reference.  For Purchased leave and other purposes **Steps**  1\. Have the applicant complete the Salary Sacrifice  Declaration form. Check the form has been completed in line  with requirements as per **[Rules](#R_S_or_W_Salary_Sac_deductions)** [\> Base income \>](#R_S_or_W_Salary_Sac_deductions) [Salary Sacrifice, Fringe Benefit deduction, Pre\-Tax deductions](#R_S_or_W_Salary_Sac_deductions)  Note: If  the applicant has not indicated the deduction is  voluntary, can be cancelled at any time and received as  taxable income then you can\-not use the salary sacrificed  income for serviceability calculations.  In addition, (where policy requires this declaration) if the  applicant has not confirmed they would cancel the  deduction if required to meet their existing commitments and  the repayments for the loan they have requested, then you  can\-not use the salary sacrificed income for serviceability  calculations.   2\.  In the employer income calculator,  **ensure you complete the fields**: * Pre\-tax deductions required for servicing? **Yes / No** * Pre\-tax deduction \> **Input the actual amount from the payslip**.  (The amount  field must be completed even where the income is not used  for serviceability assessment)  **Note:** The  salary sacrifice (pre\-tax deduction) amount loaded must be  \>\=$0\. All salary sacrifice fields displayed are to be  completed. For example, where more than single years  documents are obtained complete both the Current Year and  Prior Year columns.  Where there has been a change to  base income, the pre\-tax deduction amount prior to the base  increase must also be entered.  The salary sacrifice  amount can vary depending on the applicant's salary  sacrifice arrangements at any point in time.   3\. The calculator will: * Determine base and non\-base income * Provide gross income amount to enter into ApplyOnline * Provide an Annual gross income amount to enter into ApplyOnline * Provide an Annual 'Bonus' amount to enter into ApplyOnline  4\.

If a loan application is referred to Credit a copy of the  calculation must be available with the loan documentation  for reference.   6**.** Any corresponding debt /  commitment that relates to the salary sacrifice amount must  be included in ApplyOnline   7\. For car lease payments only the finance portion of the  car lease is to be included as an outgo in ApplyOnline (i.e.  the car running costs are to be included the declared Living  Expenses and do not need to be included as an  outgo).  Note: * Often a novated lease may not be cancelled and taken as an increase in gross taxable income due to the potential financial implications to the customer. * Salary sacrifice may be linked to an expense. Ensure the  expense is included in customer declared expenses where  appropriate e.g. transport in customer declared expense, or  car loan repayments in liabilities refer [Living expenses](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000700). |

### [4\.1 Foreign income and employment \- FAQs](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#F_Foreign_income_and_employment-FAQs>)


   

 

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| My applicant is an Australian Citizen living and working in the UK, but they don't have dual citizenship, do I need to ask them for their work visa? | Yes, you need to confirm they are legally able to work in the UK before proceeding with the application. |
| My applicant has recently become an Australian Citizen, previously they had a Chinese passport, but for this application they have provided me with a copy of their Australian passport. Because they were previously a Chinese citizen, do I still need to get a work permit if they are now living and working in China? | As China does not permit dual citizenship with Australia, yes, the applicant will need to provide evidence of their work permit before proceeding with the application. |
| My applicant is not a resident of Australia, they live and work in China and have a Chinese passport, do I need a work permit? | No, as the applicant is living and working within the same country that they have citizenship with, they will not require a work permit. However, this applicant would meet the non\-resident definition and is not an acceptable applicant type. |
| My applicant has provided me with a copy of their Indian passport, they have also given me a copy of their Australian 190 visa, but they are currently living and working in Dubai. What do I need to do? | This applicant's income does not comply with the visa matrix requirements, 190 visa type must earn AUD. If the 190 visa is ignored, then this applicant is a non\-resident of Australia. In both scenarios the applicant is unacceptable to the bank and no lending permitted. |


  

 ### [4\.2 Salary Sacrifice \- FAQs](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#F_Salary_Sacrifice-FAQs>)


  

 

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| The narratives on the payslips show 'voluntary superannuation contribution' or non\-SG contribution \- why do I still need to get the customer to complete the salary sacrifice deduction declaration form. | The salary sacrifice deduction declaration form helps us  have a conversation with our customer and record the outcome  of those discussions.   In some cases the applicant's may be unwilling or unable to  cancel the deductions, it is important that we do not make  an assumption that the amount of the deduction is going to  be available to meet this new loan commitment.   For example:  1\. The voluntary salary sacrifice deduction on the payslip  is being used by the applicant towards a Self\-Managed  Superannuation Fund Home Loan.  Because of the shortfall between rent received on the  investment property and the SMSF Home loan repayment, the  applicant is unable to cancel the deduction.   2\. The applicant's employer pays an additional  superannuation contribution above SG where the employee  makes a voluntary contribution. If the employee cancels the voluntary contribution, then they will lose the benefit of the above SG employer contribution.  The applicant is unwilling to cancel the deduction as  they will suffer a long term financial impact.   3\. The applicant has previously had a marital financial  settlement.  So they can rebuild their superannuation  they are making voluntary contributions. As they are planning for their retirement, they are unwilling to cancel the voluntary contribution amount. |
| When don't I need to get the salary sacrifice deduction declaration form | If the amount of the salary sacrifice deduction is not  required for serviceability assessment, then you do not need  a salary sacrifice deduction declaration form. Your loan  serviceability assessment will be based on the lower income  figure.   The deduction is an after\-tax deduction.  While you may  need to include the deduction as a commitment or living  expense, it is not reducing the customer's taxable income  and no salary sacrifice declaration form is  required. |
| Why would my customer not be able to cancel a deduction for purchased leave? | The applicant may need to contact their employer to  check under what basis they are able to cancel the  deduction.   For instance if the applicant has already taken the leave,  repayment amount may be spread over the remaining year and  might be unable to cancel the deduction. |
| Why can't my customer cancel their novated lease deduction? | Early cancellation of the novated lease may result in  negative tax implications for the customer.    They need to investigate with both their employer and seek  taxation advice to make a fully informed decision about any  financial implications of cancelling the novated lease. |
| If I don't use the salary sacrifice deduction amount for serviceability assessment, do I still need to load the commitment or living expense? | Yes you do.   Even if the income is not used for serviceability assessment  you must include the commitment or living  expense. |
| Why can't I load Salary Sacrifice deduction amounts as un\-taxed income? | If the applicant did not have the deduction pre\-tax, then the income would form part of their taxable income. |
| If I still have to verify details of the commitment related to the salary sacrifice deduction how has this helped me do my job? | Prior to the introduction of the Salary Sacrifice  Declaration form, our verification rules had different  processes when the employer was a Government and not for  profit organisations v's non\-Government.   Through the introduction of the declaration form, we could  simplify the processing of applications with salary  sacrifice deductions and help ensure our customers more  informed of the income we are using for serviceability  assessment. |

 ### [2\.3 Streamlined Refinance \- Serviceability](<https://kevin-mcisaac.github.io/policy-pal-pages/WBC_Mortgage_Broking_OBP_Policy#2.3 Streamlined Refinance - Serviceability>)


Standard serviceability and income verification policy applies, refer [Serviceability Assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710) and [Verifying Income](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000721).


However, where all Streamlined Refinance eligibility criteria and conditions are met, but serviceability is not met under standard serviceability assessment, a modified Serviceability Assessment Rate (SAR) may be applied as an exception to serviceability policy as below, via referral to Credit:


* A minimum interest rate buffer of 1\.00% (in lieu of 3\.00%) will be applied in the Benchmark Repayment Amount, where SAR considers the final rate plus interest rate buffer in the serviceability calculation, for the new and / or any existing consumer mortgage liability(s)\*.
* The standard Floor Rate will continue to apply in the Benchmark Repayment
 Amount Calculation, refer [Serviceability Assessment](https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710) \> Serviceability Assessment Rate (SAR) – Mortgage.


Where Credit use this exception approach and approve an application based on a minimum 1% buffer SAR assessment, this must be captured as a servicing Override with Streamlined Refinance as the secondary reason code.


\*Secured mortgage types eligible to be assessed using the modified 1% approach, where serviceability is not met under standard serviceability policy:


* New consumer / residential lending:
	+ Mortgages – Owner occupied and investment
* Existing consumer / residential liabilities:
	+ Mortgages – Owner occupied and investment
	+ Portfolio loans and other secured lines of credit
