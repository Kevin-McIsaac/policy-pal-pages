<h3><a name="R_Reducing_living_expenses"></a><strong>2.2&nbsp;Reducing living expenses</strong></h3>
We acknowledge that a customer may change their spending behaviour when they have a new mortgage repayment obligation or following a change in circumstances (e.g. children moving out of parent's house).<br />
<br />
We accept that such a change often involves a reduction in discretionary (non-essential) expenses such as recreation, entertainment, clothing, personal care and groceries. It is less likely that a customer can easily reduce expenses that are more stable by nature such as insurances, property-related costs, utilities, education and telephone. Refer to Expense category tables <span><span><span>in <a data-tagid="R_Living_expenses_compared_to_HEM" href="#R_Living_expenses_compared_to_HEM">Living Expenses compared to HEM</a></span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>and <a data-tagid="R_Living_expenses_not_compared_to_HEM" href="#R_Living_expenses_not_compared_to_HEM">Living Expenses not compared to HEM&nbsp;</a></span></span></span>to identify discretionary v’s non-discretionary expense types.<br />
<br />
Where the customer has told us that they are prepared to reasonably change their lifestyle to reduce living expenses, we may adjust customer declared expense amounts in the loan assessment system provided:
<ul>
	<li>Broker has had a robust discussion with customer around their living expenses patterns; <strong>and </strong></li>
	<li>The reduction appears reasonable; <strong>and</strong></li>
	<li>Overall comments are recorded in ApplyOnline detailing:
	<ul>
		<li>the customer discussion</li>
		<li>what expenses have been adjusted and by how much</li>
		<li>the reasons why the reductions were deemed acceptable by the Broker.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
The customer declared amount cannot be accepted for any outgoing child support, alimony or rent (post settlement). The amount of the payment must be verified, for further information refer to <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690"><em>Commitments</em></a> <em>policy</em><br />
&nbsp;
<h3><a name="R_Conflicting_information"></a><strong>2.3&nbsp;Conflicting information</strong></h3>
After the declared living expenses have been captured, we may need to make further enquiries if

<ul>
	<li>during the assessment of the application we identify information which conflicts with the declared expenses&nbsp;<span><span><span>as per </span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000698">Loan Application and Approval</a> &gt; </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>Validation of information provided by the customer policy</span></span></span></li>

<h3><a name="R_Living_expenses_compared_to_HEM"></a><strong>2.4&nbsp;Living expenses compared&nbsp;to HEM</strong></h3>
These living living expense:

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>categories will be compared to the HEM value; <b>and</b></span></span></span>

	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span>the higher of the declared expenses or HEM will be used in the serviceability calculation</span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span>are used to calculate the expense to net [discounted] HEM ratio at application level. This is used to assist in:</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>understanding the &nbsp;level of expenses; <b>and</b></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>&nbsp;identifying where they are materially different (higher or lower) to the Household Expenditure Measure .

</ul>
<span><span><span>Applications where the declared living expenses are assessed as materially low in relation to their income and insufficient to maintain a reasonable standard of living will require further detailed commentary and mitigation before approval can be considered.</span></span></span><br />

<h3><a name="R_Definition_of_a_Dependant"></a><strong><span><span>2.14 Definition of a Dependant</span></span></strong></h3>
<span><span>A dependant is defined as: </span></span>

<ul>
	<li>a child under the age of 18 years; or</li>
	<li>a child aged 18 years or older who lives with the applicant, receives no income from government benefits, employment or other income sources, and is totally financially reliant on the applicant (e.g. A full time unemployed student, or a child with a disability living at home permanently)</li>
</ul>
<span><span>where the applicant has legal responsibility for the care and welfare of the child, on either a full or part time basis.&nbsp;<strong>Note:</strong> The child under the age of 18 years may or may not reside with the applicant.<br />
<br />
Unborn children&nbsp;are not considered dependants. </span></span><span><span><span> Variance to this rule where <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710"> Serviceability Assessment </a> &gt; Parental leave – use of ‘return to work’ income’ policy is applied.&nbsp; </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span>Any additional expenses for children over the age of 18 living at home need to be captured in the living expenses discussion with the customer.<br />
<br />
If applicants are expecting to add to their family, this should be identified during completion of Responsible Lending requirements by way of question: Do you expect any significant changes to your financial situation over the next 3 years that would adversely impact your ability to meet your repayments?&nbsp; Refer to <em><span><a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000710">Serviceability Assessment</a> </span></em></span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span>Where the child does not reside with the applicant it is acceptable to use an outgoing child support payment in place of including the child as a dependant for serviceability purposes. If no child support is paid or child support is paid and the child resides with the applicant the child must be included as a dependant for serviceability purposes. Any shared custody arrangements should be clearly explained in the application<br />
<br />
The amount of any outgoing child support payment must be verified for further information refer to <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690"><em><span>Commitments</span></em></a></span></span> <span><span>policy&nbsp;</span></span><br />

<span> When rental income used in the serviceability assessment is rental income (in AUD) From a property rented on a short term basis and this property was rented for the full 52 weeks of the year. The expenses declared on the rental schedule other that interest, depreciation and once off capital expenses must be used. <span lang="EN"><span><span>Refer to <a href="https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000721"> Verifying Income </a>&gt; Supplementary income &gt; Rental income (in AUD) Rent received on a short term basis</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span>Where the short-term rental property has not been rented for the full 52 weeks of the year, expenses incurred when the property is not rented are to be entered into customer expenses either as an owner occupied primary or owner-occupied secondary expenses. The lender should discuss with the customer to determine whether the property is owner occupied primary or owner occupied secondary and document accordingly. </span><br />
<br />
<span>If the property is owner-occupied and has a separate area of occupancy (granny flat) being used for short term rent, the owner-occupied portion of expenses is to be separated from the investment portion. Like above, the investment portion can be determined from the rental schedule in the tax return and the owner-occupied portion can be determined through a customer conversation.&nbsp;</span><br />
