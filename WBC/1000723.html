			The definition of peak debt has been updated to:<br />

No package discounts are applied to the IO variable interest rate. </span></span></span></span></li>

				<span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>
			Where a document(s) is used in combination with another document(s), a simpler narrative may be acceptable and must adhere to any requirements detailed in the specific policy.<br />
